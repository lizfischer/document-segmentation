The paper is the same throughout \n                            so, presumably, it was furnished by the publishers. \n                              Though  this \u2018Tome\u2019 in unpressed condition would make a volume  more  than two \n                            inches thick it is recommended in the preface \u2018in steade of a merie cdpani\u00e9 to shorten \n                            the tedious toyle of wearie wayes\u2019. \n                              The importance of this book as the medium through which much that was character- \n                            istic of Italian Renaissance culture was introduced to English readers can hardly be \n                            exaggerated{}. Miss Scott has traced forty-three Elizabethan plays whose plots are \n                            to be found in the hundred and one tales included in the final early editions of both \n                            volumes. Among  the forty-three plays are five of Shakespeare\u2019s. Equally important, \n                            also, was the stimulus which it gave to Greene and  Forde and  the other  English \n                            \u2018novelists\u2019. \n                              The present copy has been called the \u2018finest copy known\u2019 and no doubt it is, for the \n                            only comparable one, the British Museum (Nassau-Heber (VIII, Lot 1829)-Grenville) \n                            copy which is also very fine and clean, cannot match it in size. It is not a rare book in \n                            point of numbers, its bulk has prevented that, but there are few books which are more \n                            difficult to find complete and in good condition.

Therefore, it is not possible to \n         state what  new  matter is included in the cancellans, but it can be estimated, from the \n         crowding   of the setting and the use of more  than  the usual thirty-four lines to the \n         page,  that it consisted of approximately  two pages of text. It may  be observed also \n         that at that point an error in the numbering of the novels occurs which is not resolved \n         for six sheets and which  is perhaps reflected in the foliation given in the Summarie. \n            It has not previously been noticed  that the outer forme of the first sheet occurs in \n         two  settings (except for verso [#4] which  is the same in both). It is not possible to \n         dogmatize   as to which is the earlier for the evidence appears to be contradictory. In \n         the other  setting of the title, the \u2018Clarke\u2019, cf. Plate No.XXXvV, the third to seventh \n         lines read: \u2018| contepning manifolve {tore of goodlp | Hiftories, Tragicall matters, and | other \n         Morall argument, | very requisite for de- | light @ profit. |\u2019; the tenth line ends with a \n         full stop instead  of a  colon; and  \u2018Clarke\u2019, eleventh line, instead of \u2018Clerke\u2019. On \n         verso  *2 and   recto [+3] the text is entirely reset with only  minor  typographical \n\n[ 795 ] \n\n        VOL.IIL\n\nchanges, e.g. the proper nouns being printed in italic instead of roman asin the presentf. \n                            \u2018The set of fine large ornamental initials used in this book is copied with considerable \n                         fidelity from a set of Greek initials designed for Robert Estiennef. Twenty-two different \n                         initials are here used, the only letters lacking to make a complete Elizabethan alphabet \n\n                        are E,K and X.                                      .               . \n                          It is not possible to determine for what reason Painter changed  his publishers \n\n                          between the printing of the first volume and the present. However, it was probably \n                          because William Jones had retired from active publishing for he entered no books in \n                          the Stationers\u2019 Register after the first volume and, though he was  still living, the \n                          second edition of that volume was published by Thomas  Marshe,  1569. \n\n                               fOther copies of the present \u2018Clerke\u2019 setting are in the Bodleian (Malone), Huntington (Ashburnham-Hoe), \n                                  British Museum  (Nassau-Heber-Grenville), Wilmerding  (Seth Terry),  and the  Borden-Wallace-Levy \n                                 copy  now at the Rosenbach Company.

In one, e.g. the present, see Plate No.XXXVI, it reads \u2018Caueat Emptor.\u2019, \n             while in the other and more  common  issue it reads \u201cBy H.P.\u2019. \n\n                {The omission  of numbers 209 and 210 is not the result of editorial vagary, but apparently a printer's error \n                  arising from the fact that the 207th Epigram  and the one now  numbered  \u201c208\u201d occupy two pages each. \n                                the compositor numbered   the second page of the 207th Epigram  as a separate one \u2018208's \n                                                th he numbered  \u2018209\u2019 and \u2018210\". The error obviously was not detected at \n                                                                                may exist in which the epigrams are still \n\n                   Presumably, \n                   and  the two  pages  of the 208 \n                   least until after the next sheet was printed. A state of sheet H \n                   divided. \n\n                           (797 ] \n\n            VOL.IIL\n\nThe principal variation between the two issues lies in the preliminaries which in the \n                            present occupy a half-sheet and in the \u201cBy BLP! issue, a quarter-sheet. In both issues \n                            the contents of the preliminaries are substantially the same except that the  Latin \n                            verses on the recto of the fifth leaf of the present do not appear in the other. The gen- \n                            erous spacing of the setting of the present, together with the fact that the phrase \n                            \u2018Caueat Emptor\u2019 is quoted as part of the title in the entry in the Stationers\u2019 Register, \n                            make it seem probable that this represents the earlier state. In that case, the omission \n                            of the Latin sestet was probably due to considerations of printing-house  economy, \n                            though the author\u2019s initials on the title was perhaps the original cause. Parrot\u2019s name \n                            is given in full at the end of the Latin address in both issues; consequently the con- \n                            verse argument that the present issue is the later because in it the author\u2019s name is \n                            omitted from the title can have no weight. \n                              There are further variations in the text of the volume made apparently  while the \n                            sheets were in the press for an examination of the Bodleian copies shows that either \n                            state may occur with either title. The variations noted are found on recto B2 and on \n                            verso [Q6]. In some copies, e.g. the Bodleian example of the Caueat issue, the sixth \n                            Epigram  of the first book, recto B2, has the motto \u2018Ignotae, nulla Cupido\u2019  and  is \n                            rather more than usually coarse, in others, e.g. the present, a different epigram with \n                            the motto  \u2018Magnis fortuna nocet\u2019 is substituted. Again, the 215th Epigram   of the \n                            second book, verso [Q6], in some copies, e.g. the original leaf in the present, has the \n                            mottoes  \u2018Sapiunt quecunque  probantur\u2019  and \u2018Semel  infaniuimus  omnes\u2019,  while in \n                            others, e.g. the inserted leaf in the present, the mottoes read \u2018Poft carnes Cafeus\u2019 \n                            and \u2018Bis infaniuimus omnes\u2019f. \n                              Only  two other copies of the Caueat Emptor  issue can be  traced, both in public \n                            collections, the Bodleian (8\u00b0C.82.Art.) and British Museum (Henry Francis Lyte); of \n                            the other issue seven copies are known, viz. two in the  Bodleian  (Malone;  Wood, \n                            imperfect), Queens College Cambridge, Huntington  (Bridgewater),  Harvard  (Locker- \n                            White),  Folger (Steevens-Woodhouse-Blandford-Heber-Corser-Hoe),     and  the C.W. \n                            Clark (Walpole-Utterson-J.D.Gardner-Huth-Jones)   copy. \n\n                                    The   entry for this book in the Stationers\u2019 Register gives the title as: \u2018. . .

The play was  entered along with four other dramatic  pieces, \n            14th  May   1594, to  Islip. He apparently sold  his rights to Edward  White  shortly \n            thereafter for Islip\u2019s name is cancelled in the entries and White\u2019s substituted. In at \n            least one case, Greene\u2019s  Friar Bacon  1594, White\u2019s name  appears  in the imprint as \n            publisher and  Islip, from the evidence of ornaments, was  the printer. In the present \n            there is no  indication of the identity of the publisher who  may   have  been White \n            although,  in the interval of five years, Islip may have regained his title. \n              Some   sixteen copies of this play can be traced, of which at least ten are in public \n            libraries. \n\n               #The  Mostyn-Clawson   copy, now  in the possession of the Rosenbach Company,  is the only one with the \n                 blanks intact. \n               tThe headlines of the outer formes of sheets B-G read \u2018Dauid and Berfabe.' while the inner read \u2018Dauid and \n                 Bethfabe\u2019. In sheet H the order is reversed. It should be observed that throughout the headlines are from \n                 the same setting with swash or non-swash letters in the same relative positions, etc., indicating that these \n                 sheets were composed  and printed-off forme by forme and that as each was completed the type was dis- \n                 tributed except for the headlines which were left in the chase. \n\n             S.T.C, 19540.

Newton, carrying him his final Thanks \n          for his kind paines upon occafion of a late Queftion touching \u00a5 Odds between fome \n          given Chances  upon Dice. \n\n            Norte: 1 In November   1693, John Smith, the writing master at Christ\u2019s Hospital, asked Pepys \n                 for an introduction to Newton that he might seek an answer to questions concerning hazards \n                 at dice. The question had arisen by reason of a lottery then the talk of the town.

So much am J fallen, \n           farther than ever I was, from y* Gusto of any Satisfaccon to be fetcht from without= \n           doors, since by y\u00ae Seperation or other Avocations of y* few Friends I had remaining \n           of them whofe Conversacons  were my just Delight, I have so little left me of it within; \n           And  what with  your Iamblichus, Stobeus, Eugubinus  & 2. or 3. more Domesticks of \n           your recomending,  I can make  shift to entertain myselfe better by myselfe, than at \n           this time of day to be looking-out for New Acquaintance. Besides that (to tell you y\u00a2 \n           Truth) a  Friend of this sort at York is little other than a Death\u2019s Head to me here; \n           the Distance of y\u00b0 One  filling me with Contemplacons as Ghastly as y\u00ae Prefence of \n           the Other.

Monday  Marth  23. 17034. \n           S! I have been in continued hopes of y\u00ae favour of Your promised Visit, or at leaft of \n           that of Df Charlett\u2019s (whom I have not seen nor heard Syllable from, but by You thefe \n           6. Months) or You  had been sooner called-on from mee upon y\u00ae Subject of Yours of \n           Saturday laft. \n             The Truth  is, I am not a little furprised at y\u00a9 maner of our learned Friend\u2019s pro- \n           ceeding with me on that Occasion: and You shall soon know why. \n             In y meantime,  pray let y\u00b0 Bearer my Servant bring me word when You heard last \n           from Oxford about it, & from whom,  & particularly whether from D! Charlett or no; \n           and if You please, forbear giving any Orders about y* Frame till You hear further. \n             I have not now  for some Years been  able to bear y\u00ae Stones of London, nor dare \n          flatter myselfe when I shall; or I should much rather by my Visits ease both You & \n           myselfe of this way of Supplying it; being moft truly S* \n                                   Yo! faithfull & most humble ferv! \n                                               S Pepys. \n\n            Nores:  1 This letter, together with Pepys\u2019s answer, both here first printed, are missing from \n                 the correspondence  regarding Dr.  Wallis\u2019s picture which Rachael Poole edited for the \n                 Bodleian Quarterly Record VUI, pp.286-290. Two letters which precede the present, one from \n                 Kneller to Pepys September 1701, and Pepys\u2019s reply, are now lost. That they were sent and \n                 something of their contents may  be deduced from  Kneller\u2019s letter to Pepys of 24 March \n                 1702 (Braybrooke  V, 1849, pp.401-2). \n                   We  know  from the diaries of Hearne and David Gregory that Kneller went to Oxford in \n                 September  1701 to paint Dr. Wallis\u2019s portrait. Wallis wrote a letter of thanks to Pepys, 24 \n                September,  which  Kneller delivered along with the lost note of his own which announced \n                that he had painted  the face and would proceed with the rest in due course. Pepys replied \n                 approving what  Kneller had done and  encouraged him  to finish the portrait. Apparently, \n                 Kneller took nearly six months to complete the task and then announced it to Pepys in the \n                present letter. Pepys was not enjoying very good health and had been irritated by Dr. Char- \n                lett\u2019s continued silence. He therefore answered Kneller\u2019s note with his of 23 March, tran- \n                scribed above, written in a captious spirit to which Kneller responded warmly  in his of \n\n               24 March. \n\n       VOL.II                     [ 813 ]\n\nPepys was, no doubt, pleased that he had kept this copy of his reply for he was shocked \n                                     by the vehemence of Kneller\u2019s answer. He immediately sent a reply (op.cit. V, p.402) which \n                                     began: \u2018For God\u2019s sake (my old Friend) look once more  over my  letter of yesterday [i.e, \n                                     that quoted above] and tell me what  one word  there is in it that should  occasion one \n                                     syllable of what my man brings me this morning in answer to it . . . \n                                   2 The frame finally chosen was lacquered, not gilt. \n                                   3 Kneller\u2019s orthography probably records his Liibeck origin. \n\n                      PEPYSIANA,    see MSS. 14, 414, 41\u00a2 and 104\u00a2.",

Their spacing, also, may have \n                                     been affected by the publication of other editions no longer known,                 , \n\n[ 814 ]\n\ntthe   belief that this was the Steevens copy appears to be based upon a misreading of a manuscript note \n                still retained in the book. \n             \u00a7This letter is reprinted from the copy th \n                Epistles, pp.38-40, edited by Hazlitt for Huth. \n\n                                                        en in the possession of R.S.Turner in the Prefaces, Dedications and \n\n        VOL.                       [ 815 ]\n\nThe second edition is typographically remarkable for, unlike the three other undated \n                             editions, it has none of Watkins\u2019s devices or ornaments on the title (reproduced Dodd \n                             Mead  The Rowfant Books [1906] p.62) so that it might not unreasonably, upon a super. \n                             ficial inspection, be suspected of being a Pirated edition. This linipreseion is heightened \n                             by the fact that, unlike all the other editions, it does not have Watkins\u2019s prefatory note \n                             (recto [Aq] of present). However, a closer examination reveals the presence of two \n                             factotums which were the joint property of Thomas  Dawson   and Richard  Gardiner, \n                             trade-printers who were employed by Watkins  to print at least three other booksta, \n                             Where the readings of Edition I differ from III and IV, the second edition usually has \n                             the readings of the first in those cases where the differences are purely literal, but at the \n                            same  time it has the long interpolationsta, which appear in the later editions. \n                               The evidence regarding the relative order of the third and fourth editions is some- \n                            what  simplertta. On the titles of both Watkins used a device (McK.n.188) which in the \n                            interval between printing them he had altered\u00a7@ by excising the shading. \n                               Six editions, seven counting Warton\u2019s, in less than forty years is no mean achieve- \n                            ment  for a purely literary work of this period, unless indeed it is compared with the \n                            popularity of Lyly\u2019s novels. Furthermore, it shows that Pettie\u2019s work was not so over- \n                            shadowed  and forgotten upon the appearance of Lyly\u2019s as has usually been supposed. \n                               The importance of Pettie in the history of English prose style is not always recog- \n                            nized. In discussing the origin and development of English euphuism J.D. Wilson (John \n                            Lyly 1905, pp.40-2) says: \u201c . . . No one, reading the Petite Pleasure, can doubt that \n                            Pettie was the real creator of euphuism in its fullest development, and that Lyly was \n                            only animitator . . . The sole difference between the styles of Lyly and Pettie is that, \n                            while Pettie\u2019s similes from nature are simple and natural, Lyly, with his knowledge of \n                            Pliny and the bestiaries, added his fabulous \u2018unnatural natural history\u2019 . . . In truth, \n\n  \n\n                                    faln 1577 these two partners printed Breton\u2019s Workes of a young wyt with a title having the same peculiar \n                                      format as the second edition of Pettie. It is of interest, though perhaps of no great significance, to note \n                                      that the original entry for Breton\u2019s book was also made by Richard Watkins, \n                                    JeAmounting  altogether to nearly two pages of text and mainly consisting of somewhat specifically cynical \n                                      remarks concerning chastity, matrimony and other matters hymeneal. \n                                        At least one rather unaccountable reading appeared in Edition IT which was perpetuated  in the later \n                                      ones. The second paragraph  of Amphiaraus  and  Eriphile begins in Edition  I: \u2018Fabritius, an ancient \n                                      Romain .  . . \u2019, which is correct; while in Editions I-IV it begins: \u2018Valerius, an auncient in 111 and 1V \n                                      \u2018ancient'] Romain . . . ' which by no ordinary rule can be called a corruption. \n                                   Halt  should be noted that the present order is not that set forth by Sir Israel Gollancz in his edition of this \n                                     work  but the reverse. Nevertheless, his notes further substantiate this order for, where the readings of \n                                      Editions III and IV differ, almost always III has the readings of I, and IV has those of the edition of 1608. \n                                      Gollancz numbers Edition III \u2018C\u2019 and IV \u2018B\u2019. Edition II was not known to him. \n                                   \u00a7alt has not been possible to date this alteration except to state that it evidently occurred before 1598) \n                                     when  Watkins  ceased activity. Moreover, the compartment,  McK.   and  F.n.141, which  Watkins   used \n                                     on  the title of Edition IIT did not come into his possession until 1 579. In both of these editions, also, a \n                                     large ornamental initial was used on recto 2, as well as a neat tailpiece on verso, which were at one time \n                                     the property of John Charlewood whose  widow  in 1 $93 married James Roberts,  partner at that time of \n                                      Watkins, Therefore, a date after 1593 and before 1598 is probable, \n\n  \n\n[ 816 ]\n\nS.T.C. 19819.

Regarding  its omission in the first edition see note supra. Despite Pettie\u2019s con- \n             demnation of it that book has considerable interest and even in the seventeenth century \n             was  thought  by a \u2018W.Reynes\u2019  to be worthy  of translating \u2018per gusto suo\u2019f. \n                Copies of this edition exhibit minor variations, at least in quires A and N. In one \n             setting, e.g. a copy in the Harmsworth  Library, a passage reading \u2018fmall proofe of my \n             good  will, and to affure your felfe of\u2019 was omitted from the end of the dedication as \n             printed in the first edition. In the other, the inner sheet of quire A was reset with the \n             passage supplied  (recto Aq); and with  a few small variations in the outer forme, e.g. \n             line 25, recto A3 begins \u2018pofsibly procure . . . \u2019 instead of \u2018pen pofsibly procure . . . \u2019. \n             In quire N, the outer sheet was reset, possibly because of miscalculation or other acci- \n             dent. In one setting, Sig N is signed \u2018N.i.\u2019 and misnumbered \u2018121\u2019 while the last line of \n             text on recto reads  \u2018ignorance ioyned  . . . \u2019. In the other setting, e.g. the present, \n             Sig N  is signed \u2018N.\u2019, numbered  97 (correctly), and the last line reads \u2018to the faying \n\n               Sold  Sotheby's 18  May  1921, Lot 683 now Folger MS.  1008.1. \n\n          VOL.

No particular order of setting can be deduced but it may be worth  remarking \n                              that the signatures of the first leaves of quires A-P, R and  Cc-Gg,  are signed  \u20186.\u2019; \n                              while those of quires Q and  S-Bb  are signed \u20180.i.\u2019. Furthermore, from  the  form of \n                              signature used in one setting and the misnumbering of the folio in the same setting it \n                              would  appear that that sheet was set-up after quire Q and that the headlines were left \n                              in the chase. \n                                 Copies of this edition are by no means uncommon.

Farmer notes laid in. \n\n                             Tere   are three editions of this poem dated 1550; two of them purport to be the sec- \n                             ond. These latter may be easily distinguished by the fact that in one, e.g. the present, \n                             the word \u2018tyme\u2019 in the second line of the title is so spelled while in the other it is \u2018time\u2019. \n                             It must be admitted that there is very little evidence with which to justify a decision \n                             regarding the order of these two \u2018seconde\u2019 editions. Professor Skeat regarded the edi- \n                             tion reading \u2018tyme\u2019 as the later on the grounds that in that position the text of the \n                             three 1550 editions is progressively corrupt which on the whole is certainly true. How- \n                             ever, such a disposition ignores what distinctly bibliographical evidence there is. For \n                             example, the signatures of the preliminary leavestt and also the foliation of the text in \n                             the \u2018tyme\u2019 edition are very irregular (see above) whereas in the \u2018time\u2019 edition they are \n                             completely regularized. If this evidence be considered conclusive, many of the variant \n                             readings which Skeat declared corruptions would then be designated corrections. \n                               The  editions published by Crowley are of Skeats\u2019s so-called \u2018B-text\u2019 and are of inter- \n                             est and importance equal to that of the manuscripts which have  survived. \n\n                                     Several copies which we have examined, however,  are made up with  sheets partly of one and partly of the \n                                       other edition. It is not possible to state categorically that such copies are the result of comparatively recent \n                                       sophistication but they appear to be despite the probability of confusion in the shop where three editions \n                                       were printed in one year. \n                                     Hi The first edition has only two preliminary leaves, +2, \n\n                                  S.T.C. 19907.

It contains at the end two lives which are not Plutarch\u2019s. They were written \n           for the Latin translation of Campani, 1470, and later translated into French by Charles \n          de  la Sluce (l\u2019Ecluse), 1567, when the comparison of Simon  Goulard  Senlisien was \n          appended. \n             Since this translation forms the major source for the plots of Shakespeare\u2019s classical \n          plays as well as suggestions for numerous passages in the non-Roman ones, it is of con- \n          siderable interest to Shakespearean scholars that the identity of the particular edition \n          used  by him  should be established. Since there were four editions published in the \n          dramatist\u2019s lifetime, the problem is one which involves a large amount of collation. The \n          edition of 1612, the one selected by Skeat and Collier, although a copy of it said to have \n          been the poet\u2019s property is now in the Greenock Library, may be ruled out as all of the \n          plays in question were written before that edition was published. \n             The case presented by F.A.Leo for the second edition, 1595, is more convincingf. In \n          fact, one might consider his case as proved were it not that some hints of 4 midsummer \n          night's dream are clearly derived from the Life of Theseus. As that play was written, at \n          the very latest, in 1594-5, Shakespeare must either have seen the proof-sheets of that \n          second edition at the shop of Richard Field, his fellow townsman and the printer of the \n          second, third and  fourth editions, or have used a copy of the present 1579 edition. \n          However,  it is entirely probable that Shakespeare used more than one edition. \n            It would be unaccountable  if books of this date and size were actually as rare as the \n          traceable examples of the present seem to indicate for the only other copies with the \n          present imprint  which  we have  traced are the British Museum,   Emanuel  College \n          Cambridge,  Turnbull Library Wellington  N.Z., Chapin, Owen D.

There is no reason to doubt \n                             the accuracy of this statement although only two of those editions can be traced, the \n                             present and the edition, dated 1597, of which a unique copy is in the British Museum. \n                             However,  though no copy of a third edition printed prior to the Palladis Tamia can be \n                             located, one or more copies are probably in existence for Hazlitt described an edition \n                             dated 1598 which collates A*, B-Mm8 and omits the errata (query because corrected). \n                             Such an edition would appear to be later than the present. \n                               The  popularity of this book, of which altogether some eighteen editions before the \n                             end of the seventeenth century were issued, was due it would seem to the fact that it \n                             filled a peculiar need of the public of that day. It is difficult to imagine the style and \n                             tone of the conversation of the later years of Elizabeth\u2019s court\u2014the written word is \n                             the only clue. But it is certain that the more commonly endowed members of a society \n                             which included men of such wide reading and extensive knowledge  as Bacon, Selden, \n                             Jonson and  Raleigh must have frequently felt the need of some compendium  of wise \n                             and sententious aphorisms by means of which  they might  ornament  their discourse. \n                             It is just that function which this volume appears to be intended to fulfill for it is a \n                             compilation of Precepts and maxims,  frequently with their source noted, gathered \n                            under  various heads such as \u2018Of Courage\u2019, \u2018Of Nobilitie\u2019, etc. Each division begins with \n                             a definition and ends with a Latin quotation, while the tables which are appended \n\n[ 826 ]\n\nenable   one to search not only the divisional topics, but also the individual aphorisms \n            much  in the manner of a modern  Bartlett. \n              The popularity of this type of manual in the early years of the seventeenth century \n            may  be compared  with the deluge of \u2018outlines\u2019 of this and that which the public of the \n            present day is encouraged to imagine will provide a short and easy road to knowledge \n            and culture. This appears to be substantiated by the fact that this book is but one, \n            the first of a series, of four volumesf which for the want of a better name is called the \n            \u2018Wits Series\u2019. From the fact that there is no indication in this book that it was to be \n            followed by others it may be assumed that the series, as a series at least, was not proj- \n            ected until after the demand for this first book indicated the public taste. \n              However  that may  be, in 1598 Cuthbert Burbie who was frequently associated with \n            Nicholas Ling, the publisher of the present, even publishing under his own name some \n            books for which  Ling had  made  entry and apparently continued  to hold the rights, \n           published  Meres\u2019s Palladis Tamia.  Wits treasury (q.v.] which both on the title-page \n            and in the headline throughout  purports to be \u2018The  second part of Wits Common- \n            Wealth\u2019. That  work  is likewise a compilation but this time somewhat more original \n            for it is made up of what the author calls \u2018Similitudes\u2019.

Outside \n                 of gazettes, year-books, almanacks, etc., the only other serial publications of this period which we recall \n                 are Cokes Reportes and  Reynolds  annual \u2018thriller\u2019, God's triumph against murther. \n              {This  volume  was  also intended to be  provided with tables according to the author's statement  in the \n                 \u2018Candido Lectori\u2019, (See the transcript of this address in the 7-L.S. 7 June 1928, p.430). \n              ttFurther  evidence of the relationship may be found  in the similarity of the format of that volume to the \n                 Politeuphuia and the fact that each is dedicated to Bodenham whose inspiration they both acknowledged. \n                 Moreover,  unless that be the third part of the series there seems to be no explanation for the claim of the \n\n  \n\n                 last part to be numbered  \u2018fourth\u2019. \n\n      VOLT                [ 827 ]\n\nham  or Ling\u00a7, perhaps has only a specious relationship to the earlier volumes.

Though  Burton  may have chosen  the  title purely for catch- \n                              penny reasons, he was careful to have the book printed in much the same size, just a \n                              little more than five inches in height, as are the other parts of the series. \n                                No  other copy of this second edition of the Politeuphuia appears to be in a private \n                              collection.

Further, Schelling has not hesitated to call it \n                              \u2018unquestionably the best\u2019 of the combination morality and history plays  which were \n                              popular at Elizabeth\u2019s Court in the sixties and seventies. \u2014 \n                                The  first extant edition, from the date of entry, was printed about 1570 by John \n                              Allde, the father of the printer of the present. This second edition can hardly have been \n                              printed before 1584 when Edward  succeeded to the business but, beyond that, its date \n                              can only be conjectured. The headpiece on  recto A2 we  have not  found used  before \n                              1593, and that is perhaps as late a date as can be consideredtt for after that this kind \n                              of play would be out-moded. The  large italic type of the present Col. Isaac has found \n                              used by Allde as early as 1588. \n                                 Dr. Greg has found in the Bodleian a fragment of two leaves, F2-3, of an otherwise \n                              unknown   edition with colophon reading: \u2018Imprinted at London   at | the Long  Shop \n                              adioyning vnto  | Sainte Mildreds churche in the | Pulttie bp Edward | Allde. |\u2019. Allde \n                              used this address from 1584 to 1588 and that edition is apparently a paginary reprint \n                              of John  Allde\u2019s except that the headline reads \u2018A Tragedye\u2019 on versos and  \u2018of King \n                               Cambifes.\u2019 on rectos. Greg is inclined, from this independence, to place that edition \n                              after the present but, see supra. \n                                 While only four copies of the first edition can be traced, at least fifteen of the present \n                              are known. \n\n                                    Previous   authorities have put it as late as 1608. The date of composition has recently been shown to be \n                                      earlier than 1560, see P.M.L.d.

Such  copies are usually considered as of the first \u2018issue\u2019 [i.e. state]. \n                                    Despite its unreadability as a whole this book still exercises a very genuine fascination \n\n[ 834 ]\n\nboth as an important document   in the history of the English stage and as a problem \n             concerning which, while much  is known, many  bibliographical questions still remain \n             unsolved. The history of the author's persecution by Laud, of his trial and condemna- \n             tion, of the execution of the sentences against him and the numerous echoes of it all in \n             contemporary  drama  and verse has frequently been toldf but the evidence, such as it \n             is, has not been examined  from  a purely bibliographical viewpointt. For example, \n             besides Elizabeth Allde and William Jones whose initials appear in the imprint as the \n             printers of this book, Augustine Mathewes  and Thomas   Cotes were cited as having \n             been connected with  it, and it is not unlikely that there were others for a somewhat \n             cursory examination of the book  itself indicates that it was printed in a number of \n            sections presumably  at different shopst{ although one shop may have been responsible \n             for more than one section. \n               During  the course of printing several changes were made; for example the section \n             Uuu-Zzz, Aaa*-Kkk*,   which  is numbered by  folios (513-568), appears to have been \n             inserted to take the place of four sheets Uuu-Zzz, pp.513-544. The explanation for this \n             substitution must await the discovery of the uncancelled sheets but very likely it was \n             an author\u2019s correction. In the case of sheet 4X, however, we have the testimony of the \n            licenser, Buckner, that he ordered a page\u00a7 to be cancelled. An examination of nearly \n             two dozen copies indicates that his order was fulfilled for in all copies the inner and \n            outer halves of that quire are non-conjugate. It is therefore impossible to determine \n            the nature of the passage thus condemned. \n               One of the judges in his opinion stated that he believed that Sparkes should not only \n            be fined but should in the future be prohibited from exercising his rights as a member \n            of the Stationers\u2019 Company   and only  allowed to practise his profession of binding. \n            Several of the copies examined are in uniform original gilt calf and possibly were bound \n            by  Sparkes himself. \n\n                +See particularly S.R.Gardiner Documents  relating to the proceedings against Prynne; Ward History of Eng. \n                  Dram.

In the depositions of the witnesses examined may be found several sidelights \n                  on publishing practices of that day. \n               tLord  Cottington  in his judgment  (State Trials I, 1776, col. 425) remarked concerning Michael Sparkes \n                  that\u201c...    before it [the book] was prohibited he persuaded Men to buy it, saying \u2018It was an excellent \n                  Book, and it would be called in, and then sell well\u2019\u201d. In the proceedings before the Star-Chamber (Cam- \n                  den Soc., 1877, p.3) it was objected against this book, that in one place Prynne \u2018taketh for some 7 or 8 \n                  pages followinge a greate deale of paynes to noe purpose\u2019, which charge of prolixity, with the added ones \n                  of plagiarism and dullness, appear to be more justifiable than any number of citations of seditious and \n                  libellous passages. \n               tThe   division seems to be indicated by changes in the ornamental headings to the chapters, by resetting of \n                  the headlines and by numerous  other typographical differences. Not much attention has been paid in the \n                 past to the practice of seventeenth century compositors of leaving headlines in the chase when preparing \n                  the formes for another sheet. This custom was not only very common,  but, where practicable, seems to \n                 have  been the rule. \n               \u00a7According  to Howell\u2019s State Trials IIT (1816) col. 564, it was p.711, Gardner calls it p.708, while according \n                 to the State Papers Dom. Car. I (1631-3) 524, it was p.707; but in any case, the quire is the same. \n\n           VOL.III                             [ 835 ]\n\nAccording to a pamphlet entitled 4 new discovery of the prelates tyranny 1641, pp.7-8, \n                             this work was published in December  1632 but printed at least three months  earlier \n                             (see Modern Philology XX1X,  349 n.s).

Some  copies of that first edition have the Quarl\u00e9is of Benlowes appended \n           (Sig (-)! X\u00aeY?). It was also issued separately. \n             This is the most widely known  of Quarles\u2019s works and justly so, for though neither \n           the condemnation  of Pope nor the extravagant praise of Grosart are entirely deserved, \n           it has many pleasing passages. In the address to the reader the poet defines an Emblem \n           as \u2018but a silent Parable\u2019. As pointed  out by  Courthope,  Quarles here follows the \n           allegorical principle described by Boccaccio in his Life of Dante (transl. G.R.Carpenter, \n\n           1900,  103-4). \n\n             48.T.C, 20541 is a ghost. It should be dated 1663 (or 5). The date has been altered by pen in the British \n               Museum   copy. The S.7.C. took over the mistake from the B.M. Catalogue where it has since been corrected. \n\n               There is no copy in the Huntington  Library. \n             In  some copies the contents of pp.39-40 are in the reverse order, a mistake corrected in others.

In what is \n              probably  the earliest (here called Variant A) the pages are misnumbered   (61-4) and \n              the first line of p.66 (misnumbered 62) reads \u2018Maiesties Iustice, and the rest, euidently \n              prooued\u2019. In the other two states the line quoted above is transposed to the bottom of \n              p-65, but in one  (Variant  B) the page-numbers   in the inner forme  are correctedtt \n              while in the other (Variant C, e.g. the present) only those in the outer forme have been \n              altered. \n                 In the second impression,  so-called because as stated above it is largely from the \n              same  setting as the first, the text of pp.45-58 is condensed so that the half-sheet I is \n              omitted.  There are two  issues of that impression\u2014in  one, usually placed first, p.57 \n              begins \u2018shall have\u2019; in the other, it begins \u2018being made\u2019. \n                 Raleigh\u2019s execution aroused considerable popular feeling\u00a7 and it was with the view \n              of justifying their action that this official account was issued by the Commissioners \n              appointed  to try him. Bacon has been regarded  as the sole author, but though he was, \n              by  reason of his membership  in the Council, certainly one of the authors he was not \n              the sole sponsor. In fact, according to a letter of Bacon\u2019s, quoted by Sabin, it contains \n              \u2018additions, which were very material\u2019, penned by  James himself. \n\n                  tAccording to a letter of Sir Robert Naunton\u2019s (Forlesque Papers Camden Soc. N.S. (1871) I, 67,27 Novem- \n                    ber 1618) \u2018in theyr haste, [the printers] were faine to watche 2 nights and sett 20 presses aworke at once\u2019. \n                  }There is said to be another issue of the present impression which we have not seen, In it the first and last \n                    half-sheets are from another  setting. The imprint reads: \u2018. . . deputie Printers for | the Kings most \n                    Excellent Maiestie. |...   \u2019, and the pages in I? are correctly numbered. As  the first half-sheet in the \n                    second impression  is from the setting used in the present, the \u2018deputie Printers\u2019 setting, if it exists (Sabin \n                    No.67549), is probably earlier than this. \n                  ttThe only  reason for placing this state before C is that it was the custom to print the inner forme first. \n                  \u00a7A Dutch  translation was published \u2018Ins\u2019 Graven-Hage,  By  Aert Meuris, 1619.\u2019 \n\n                $.T.C. 20653.

Most of them appear to be corrections made \n                              while the sheets were passing through the press; for example, of the seventy-odd errata \n                              listed as occurring in Books J-II, seven are corrected in the present copy though on the \n\n                                      Attention  has been called to the fact that Milton was familiar with this book and that his description of \n                                        the site and topography of Paradise resembles very closely that given in the first map, pp.64-5. \n                                      Regarding   these verses see note in T.L.S. 13 October 1932 and by Norman Ault,  7.L.S. 27 October  1932, \n                                        and authorities cited. The present version (facsimiled in Stevens, Son, and Stiles Cat. (1927) 177, Pl. XII) \n                                        differs from those recorded: \n                                                                      Ev'n such is time who takes in trust, \n                                                                        Our youth our joyes and  all we have \n                                                                      And pays vs but with age and  dust, \n                                                                        When  in y\u00ae darke and silent grave \n                                                                      And when  we have  wandred  all our wais \n                                                                        Shuts vp y\u00b0 story of our dais \n                                                                      But from y\u00ae grave, and earth, and dust, \n                                                                        The  Lord will raise me vp I trust, \n                                                                                                WR, \n\n[ 846 ]\n\nsame page  with the corrected readings are sometimes uncorrected errors also listed in \n               the Errata. Besides these minor variations, however, there are said to be a number of \n               leaves which have  been reset{}. Dr.T.N.Brushfield has made  an exhaustive study of \n               them which  was published  in the Trans. of the Devonshire Association (1909) 181-218. \n               He lists the variant readings in three series which he calls issues. It is doubtful if that \n               is the correct term to distinguish them, for in his third \u2018issue\u2019 the two passages which \n               mark it from the second do not occur on pages that were reset, and in his second \u2018issue\u2019 \n               the same is true of four \u2018readings\u2019. It has not been possible to compare copies of this \n               edition side by side and consequently judgment must  be reserved. From the evidence \n              of the present copy the reset pages noted by Brushfield are not on cancel leaves and it \n               must, for the present, remain an open question whether  or not they were effected by \n               the \u2018stop-press\u2019 method. Nevertheless, the fact remains that this copy has all of the \n               distinctive readings of Brushfield\u2019s second \u2018issue\u2019 and none of his first or third. \n                 In a copy sold at Hodgson\u2019s, 11 June 1926, Lot 368, there was a slip of errata pasted \n               on a flyleaf reading: \u2018One fault is especially to be corrected, in the 7. Chapter of the \n               first Booke, \u00a7.2.pag.99.& 100...   \u2019. \n                 Arber (Transcript V. Ixxvii) has reprinted a letter from George Abbott, Archbishop \n               of Canterbury, to the Stationers\u2019 Company,  22nd  December  1614, directing that this \n               book \u2018should be suppressed, and not suffered for hereafter to be sould\u2019. Either his order \n               was singularly ineffectual, or there were few copies left in the hands of the \u2018Station's \n               and bookesellers\u2019 at the time of the order. This last is not unlikely for Camden states \n               that the book was issued 29th March  1614. The reason for the attempted suppression \n               was stated  by John  Chamberlain   to be that Raleigh  was \u2018too sawcie in censuring \n               princes\u2019. \n                 The edition listed in the Short-Title Catalogue 20637a is a ghost. The copies in ques- \n               tion are imperfect examples  of the Stansby 1617 edition which has  no list of errata \n               although only 98 of the 130 errors listed in the present are corrected in it. \n                 There is some evidence  for believing that Ben Jonson wrote the portion concerning \n               the revolt of the mercenaries against Carthage (Book II, 371-6, 386-93) and that the \n               Rev.Robert  Burhill assisted in the \u2018drudgery\u2019. \n                 For a discussion of the problems of this volume and  its place in English historical \n               writings see paper by C.H.Firth in Proceedings of the British Academy VIII, 427-46. \n\n                  ttBook  I, [D6], pp.35-6, and G, pp.61-2; Book II, [Xxs], pp.511-2, Aaa, pp.539-40, and Bbb3, pp.s55-65 \n                    Book  IV, 40, pp.[157]-8; and Book V, 60s, pp.717-8. \n\n                S.7.C. 20637.

Probably the size and cost of the original \n                             made  such an epitome necessary. \n                               Samuel  Cartwright and Richard Best entered for this book the 6th November 1649, \n                             but  Cartwright died the following August. Stephenson, whose name  appears  in the \n                             imprint as the publisher, was not apparently a member of the Stationers\u2019 Company and \n                             his only other signed publication, Shirley\u2019s Via ad Latinam 1649 [q.v.], was entered by \n                             J.Hardesty. It is not possible, therefore, to determine whether the entry made by \n                             Cartwright and  Best was for Stephenson, or whether he acquired  the rights to this \n                             book  after Cartwright\u2019s death. \n\n                                   Evae  I, 330.

The reason for this is difficult to find for his active life was broken \n                            by intervals of enforced leisure when, if at no other time, he must have had recourse \n                            to his pen. Perhaps the explanation may be that he wrote  such a miserable, untidy, \n                            scrawling hand, full of abbreviations, contractions and unsystematic terminations as \n                            to be almost shorthand, so that his letters lack every superficial appearance of impor- \n                            tance or interest which might have preserved them. Moreover,  his letters were early \n                            collected and published and possibly, through the carelessness or thoughtlessness of the \n                            editors, the originals were destroyed after printing. \n                              All Raleigh\u2019s letters in this collection, except MS.108}, appear to have been among \n                            the series of fourteen listed by Edward Edwards (N. & Q. 4th S. II pp.s61-2) which, \n                            until late in the eighteenth century, had been preserved by the  descendants  of Sir \n                            Humphrey   Gilbert until Pomeroy  Gilbert, Fort-Mayor  of  Plymouth,  sold them  to \n                            Brand  Hollis, F.R.S., S.A., from whom they passed to Macvey   Napier, editor of the \n                            Edinburgh  Review.  They were  then, apparently, acquired by  Archibald  Constable, \n                            the Edinburgh  bookseller and were sold by Evans  16 July 1832, Lot  436. By whom \n                            they were then  consigned is not clear. Two years later they  appeared,  or at least \n                            thirteen of them, in the third Hanrott sale (1834, Lot 2060). At that time they were \n                            purchased by Thorpe who  evidently broke up the collection and sold five of the letters \n                            to John Dillon who had  them inlaid by Halliday in a magnificently extra-illustrated \n                            copy of P.F.Tytler\u2019s Life of Raleigh. At Dillon\u2019s sale, 1869, the collection passed, along \n                            with much else, into the library of Alfred Morrison of Fonthill at whose sale (IV, 1919, \n                            Lot 3059) it again came into the market. \n                              Of the fourteen letters listed by Edwards (op. cit.) Nos.s, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are in this \n                            collection. The 1st and 14th are in the Morgan Library; the 4th is in the library of Sir \n                            R.Leicester Harmsworth  (Morrison  II, 1918, Lot 980); the 6th is in the Huntington\u2019 \n                            (HM21227,   sold Sotheby\u2019s 27 November  1913, Lot 419); while the 3rd was sold with \n                            the Huth autographs  but is now untraced. \n\n                                     {That letter was also from the Gilbert papers, see below.",

This letter was printed by Cayley and Edwards from a transcript made by Dr. Thomas \n               Birch from this original when it was still in the possession of Pomeroy Gilbert (B.M.Add. MS. \n              4230  fol,85). The Friday before the 18th March 1582 would, according to our calculations, be \n              the 16th, not the 17th as given by Edwards. \n              2 The transcript reads: To my brother ft humfry Gilbert Knight refeived the 18th of Marche 1582. \n              3 Gilbert lost his life on this expedition. \n              4 This picture may be the one engraved for the Herwologia for it represents Gilbert without the \n              anchor  ornament whereas  the picture at Devonshire house has that ornament and consequently \n              is posthumous.",

While the hand, blurred and faint though it is, appears to be Raleigh\u2019s, there seems to \n                be little external evidence to support the belief that he wrote it except a reference in the Star \n                Chamber  Proceedings  for 1601 in the Sherborne business, John Mere\u2019s testimony, in which it \n               appears  that Raleigh had  previously incurred her Majesties displeasure. On the other hand, \n               if this is Raleigh\u2019s draft how did it get among the Gilbert family papers? The most disquieting \n               evidence, however, is a reference in the State Papers Domestic (1591-4) p.477, to trouble between \n                Sir John Gilbert and Lord Burgh.",

There, likewise, seems  to be no  reasonable \n                              explanation of the ellipsis between ff.26 and 28. The catchword on verso fol.26 accords \n                              with the first line on recto fol.28 and yet fol.27 is a genuine blank. \n                                The  verses (r.54)t show variant readings from those cited by either Birch or Brydges, \n                              e.g. line 2 (of the verses) \u2018and ioyes\u2019; line 4, \u2018Within the darke . . . \u2019; line 7, \u2018and \n                              Dust,\u2019; and line 8, \u2018The Lord shall raise vs vpp, I trust\u2019. \n                                 Manuscript copies of the arraignment and speech  are not uncommon,   for example, \n                              among  the Harleian MSS.  there are nine transcripts of the speech alone. \n\n                                    {These verses were first printed in Today @ man, to morrow none: or, Sir Walter Ravleigh\u2019s farewell to his \n                                      Lady London  for R.H., 1644. \n\n                       RALPH,   Joun (f.1734) Editor \n                           Se VANBRUGH,  SIR JOHN The Cornish squire 1734. \n\n                       RANDOLPH,    Rosenrr (fl.1638) Editor \n                           See RANDOLPH, THOMAS Poems 1638.",

The text, though badly arranged, \n               is superior to that of any of the later editions. \n                 As a large number  of the present are extant, it is not unlikely that more than the \n               usual number  of copies were issued. It may also be surmised that not long after this \n               collection was published  Bowman   made   some  sort of arrangement  with Richard \n               Ireland, publisher of The tealous lovers [q.v.], either by purchasing his unsold stock or \n               by exchange, so that he was able to supply copies of the Poems either with or without \n               the Lovers appended. Copies of the Poems  alone are known in contemporary  vellum, \n               calf, and morocco  while a number  of others, also in contemporary  bindings, have \n               Ireland\u2019s publication appended as in the present}. This arrangement appears to have \n               been satisfactory to both parties for the second edition of the Poems, which is in octavo, \n               has appended  an octavo edition of the Lovers with separate signatures. That octavo \n              edition of the play also occurs separately and was presumably in some cases issued that \n              way. \n                 Uncut  copies of this book are less than three-quarters of an inch taller than the \n              present. Copies of the dramatic  portion only of this volume occur frequently in the \n              market.  Possibly they were originally so issued. \n\n                  +Copies of Aristippus 1635, are sometimes found appended and presumably they were originally so sold. \n\n                S.T.C. 20694.

The present copy is also the only one recorded so that, although it has \n                              been describedf as \u2018a specimen of very indifferent versification\u2019, altogether it is a tract \n                              of considerable interest if not importance. Though the existence of this copy was known \n                               to both Ames and Herbert, neither apparently had ever seen it for they describe it as \n                               a duodecimo or octavo and date it \u2018[1588]\u2019. Ritson evidently saw the book, possibly at \n                               Farmer\u2019s sale, but (?) Haslewood just mentions the title dismissing it with the comment \n                               quoted above, while both Lowndes  and Hazlitt content themselves by  reprinting the \n                               title as it appeared in the Heber sale catalogue. \n                                 It is not, however, possible to say that as poetry this tract has been  seriously \n                               maligned; nevertheless rarity is not its sole claim to the attention of both bibliophile \n                               and student for a philologist would doubtless find much to interest him in what Ferd. \n\n                                     tCensura Literaria 1, 344. That laconic citation was probably made at second hand, for otherwise surely the \n                                       extraordinary typographical arrangement as well as the appended Elegia would have aroused some com- \n                                       ment. However,  with that possible exception, this book appears never to have been examined by those \n                                       who  have commented  upon its merit. \n\n[ 868 ]\n\nBj. \n\n                                            miferies of this tyme, \n\n                                                     EN CE that by diuine might of God, \n                                                        The wails sfirft est \n                                                               Who lent vs lif, a5 nature hight, \n                                                                     Vnjpotted and unsteande, \n                                                                          If then from age toage, encreafe \n                                                                                 Of vice, had entred in \n                                                                                       To humain hartes, and rowted nowght \n                                                                                             But rage of cancred finne, \n                                                                                                  Then longe to fore, shold extreme wrath \n                                                                                                        Of malice and of might, \n                                                                                                              Surmonted al, and wee ae led \n                                                                                                                    Our lives in fineful plight: \n                                                                                                                          But fence we fee, ech rfort of men \n                                                                                                                                In Sondrie place and Ile, \n                                                                                                                                     Some walke as in avertuous way, \n                                                                                                                                            And fome doo live but vile, \n                                                                                                                                                 We owght, and must confelfe by force, \n                                                                                                                                                       That this difformed vice, \n                                                                                                                                                             Owght not to bost of vittorie, \n\n                                                               T \n                                                                             RESENT TROBLES, AND \n\n                                                                                                                                      But a by fole furprife SHAlGL \n\n: \nA P \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Discovers 1568.

Its date alone would suffice to arouse the interest \n            of the student of English verse quite aside from its intrinsic merit and the strange- \n            ness of seeing archaic forms such as the prefixed \u2018y\u2019 in verse printed in italic type which \n            in England was  used only by classical or courtly poets like Chapman. \n              Despite the assertion of the title that this piece was printed at Antwerp a careful \n            examination  indicates that that, if not impossible, is most unlikely. Two fonts of Gara- \n            mond\u2019s roman  and  two of Grandjon\u2019s italic were used in the printing but, while similar \n            fonts were in use by Plantin at this timeft, they are not identical and furthermore the \n            graceful headpiece and initial on recto B we have not traced in Antwerp printing. On \n            the other hand, the volume has the feel and style of Paris printing while the blocks, or \n            other castings of them, as well as the types were  in the possession at that time of \n            Parisian printers\u00a7. The Antwerp   imprint may  well have  been merely  the printer\u2019s \n            device to avoid the necessity of obtaining an imprimatur. \n              Very  likely this book was not printed for sale and only a few copies were printed for \n            circulation among  the authors\u2019 friendste. Such a theory would  explain the present \n            rarity of the volume and also agree with the known facts of both Jeney\u2019s and Rogers\u2019s* \n            peregrinations. \n              The  eponymous   piece is a translation of the Discours des miseres de ce temps. A la \n            royne mere du roy, first printed at Paris in 1562 and again at Troyes, undated, but \n            possibly the same  yearta. This Discours was the first of a series of poetical attacks \n            upon the Protestant faction which Ronsard issued during the beginning of the Religious \n            Wars  in the autumn of 1562.

        "text": "Gammer Gurtons NEDLE  1575. No. 845\n\n\n\n{The  attribution to Bishop Still was first suggested by Isaac Reed upon the grounds that, in 1575, he was \n                    the only  Master of Arts of Christ's College with the initial \u2018S\u2019. John Bridges, on the other hand, had the \n                    support  of contemporary  opinion  for he is credited by Martin Marprelate  with the authorship of this \n                    comedy   and in the answering  publications of that controversy the ascription was not denied. It is now \n                    believed that  Bridges may  well have assisted Stevenson in this work. See H.Bradley\u2019s  introduction in \n                    Gayley\u2019s  Represent. Eng. Com., \u00a5.S.Boas  University Drama pp.80-88, and C.H.Ross  Anglia XIX,  306. \n                  fItis possible, of course, that the present is not the same play as that entered by Colwell but a sequel to it. \n                      \u2018The name  \u2018Gammer  gur- | sons Nedle\u2019, it has been suggested, is printed in small italic type on the title- \n                    page in such  a way that  a comparison of it with the apparently contemporary  title of Ingelend\u2019s Diso- \n                    bedient Child [g.v.] suggests that that name may have been  substituted for the original title Bpccon of | \n                    Bedlam   in the larger size of Black Letter used for the rest of the title, However, the fact that the headline \n                    throughout  reads \u2018Gammer   Gurtons  Nedle\u2019, and also that the format of this edition indicates that it may \n                    not be the first, militate against the effectiveness of this argument. \n                      \u2018The typography of this title is remarkable, however, for the fact that during the printing the type was \n                    loosened and  several letters dropped out and were replaced, not always correctly. \n                  ttAc least three are imperfect. \n\n               S.T.C. 23263.

From  the evidence  of the state of the woodcut  on \n                            verso of the title, not in this case very reliable, it would appear to have been printed \n                            after the first volume of Pynson\u2019s Froissart 1523, and therefore in 1523 or 1524. \n                               The typography  of this book is not only excellent for English work of this period \n                            but also interesting as an example of several practices not common in English printingt. \n                            In the first place there are title-signs on the rectos of the first three leaves of each \n\n                                   {There  is reason for believing that the figure depicted in Benedictine robes was intended as a portrait of \n                                      Barclay. This cut was used at least four other times by Pynson, and always in books translated by Bar- \n                                      clay. Its first appearance was in Barclay's translation of Spagnuoli\u2019s Saynt George (of which a copy is at \n                                      Trinity College Cambridge) if the date of the explicit in that book approximates the time of printing. \n                                    }The initials which Herbert describes as \u2018blooming\u2019 are used with some taste, Pynson, however,  did not \n                                      have a large supply for, having used a \u2018W\u2019 on verso B2, he was obliged to leave a space instead of another \n                                      ornamental \u2018W\u2019 on recto [Bs] of the same forme. \n\n[ 880 ]\n\nquire. Moreover,  in quires A-C there are catchwords only on the versos of the last leaf \n             of each quire; while throughout the remaining portion of the text there are catchwords \n             on  the versos of each leaf but not on the rectos. In the preliminary leaves (quire a) \n             there are catchwords  at the bottom  of each column  on both sides of the leaves. \n                This translation, \u2018the monument  proper of Barclay\u2019s Latin scholarship\u2019, is not only \n             the first rendering in English of this popular history but also a tolerably accurate and \n             easy version. The  two later editions of it are represented in this collectiontt. \n                Copies  of this first edition are uncommon\u2014we    can  locate only five others, viz. \n              British Museum    (Grenville), University Library  Cambridge   (imperfect), Rylands, \n              Chapin  (Britwell), and Ham  House. \n\n                 t}Besides  Barclay\u2019s there  were translations by  Heywood   and Crosse, and  the Latin text was  printed in \n                    England  at least five times, viz. 1569, 1573, 1601, 1615, and 1639. \n\n              S.T.C.  21626.

But it is not possible to date this with the same confidence \n                              as the first edition.

There is little evidence to support \n                              the ascription of this collection to Borde. That little, however, has been set out by \n                              F.J.Furnivall (Z.\u00a3..8. edit. Borde\u2019s Introduction pp.31-2) in rather convincing fashion \n                              although Furnivall, himself, does not accept the attribution. \n                                The  history of the copyright in this title is interesting for it was undoubtedly a \n                              profitable enterprise and was issued in many editions which have not survived. It was \n                              first entered by Thomas  Colwell (1565, Arber I.299) who, if Borde was  responsible, \n                              may  have obtained his rights from Robert Wyer. Colwell\u2019s rights were transferred by \n                              his widow to Hugh  Jackson by marriage (1577, Arber 11.676) from whom   they passed \n                              to Roger  Jackson  (1616, Arber III.s93). In 1625, they were transferred to Francis \n                               Williams (Arber IV.149) who, in 1626, issued an edition, one copy of which still sur- \n                              vives in the British Museum. His rights were transferred to John Harrison IV (1630, \n                              Arber  1V.237), and from him to John Stafford and William Gilbertson  (1655, Eyre 1, \n                              468). Gilbertson\u2019s rights were transferred to Robert White (1666, Eyre II, 364) but \n                              there is no record of what happened  to Stafford\u2019s rights.

There can be no \n                              doubt  that that edition is the one which, according to 4 Wood, \u2018was reprinted in 1680 \n                              in quarto with the old date put to it\u2019. \n                                 The other two editions both read \u2018Historie of Tithes\u2019 in the title and have the same \n                              collation, the same list of errata, and very much the same errors in the text.

Since they are printed from the same fonts \n                              both were  probably printed at the same  shop and very  likely within a short period \n                              of time. \n\n                                 As  all three of these editions include the printer\u2019s note which states \u2018As I found \n\n[ 888 ]\n\n+0n  p.4g9, this is confirmed as regards the issuance of an earlier edition \u2018halfe printed and halfe writen\u2019, \n                     No doubt,  the number  of copies so issued must have been  extremely limited which would account  for \n\n                    its apparent disappearance. \n                  {That  the imprimatur  was not printed may  be accounted for by the fact that it was not until the Star \n                    Chamber   Decree of 1637 that that practice became obligatory. \n\n                S.T.C. 22172.

Presumably,  the repetition of the last line at the junction noted above \n               was noticed  before all the quarter-sheets \u2018(F)\u2019 were printed for William Henry Miller \n               has a note in the  present copy  calling attention to the variation to be found, p.70 \n               repeated, in his other copy.

Of the others \n              the Thedais, translated by the editor of this volume, was presumably prepared for this \n              publication, while of the two others, the Hippolytus, translated by John Studeley (2), \n              was entered to Henry  Denham   (1566-7, Arber 1.336) and transferred to Richard Jones \n              and  John Charlewood   (1579, Arber 11.359); and the Hercules Oetaeus, translated by \n              Thomas   Nuce\u00a7, was  also entered to Denhamta  (1566, Arber 1.327). \n                It is not now possible to determine what arrangements, if any, Marshe, the publisher \n              of the present, made with the several owners of the copyright of the separately pub- \n              lished tragedies. Probably, if he paid them anything it was not very much for they do \n              not appear to have been very popular, and, in any case, he did not apparently acquire \n              the rights for more than this one printingta. \n                 For the most  part, the text here printed is merely a reprinting of the separate \n              editions but in one instance, the Oedipus of Neville, the text is entirely revised and \n              improved  (M.L.R.  IV, 437 and XV,  359), probably by Neville himself. \n                The  influence of Seneca  upon  the Elizabethan  drama  has been  traced, among \n              others, by Professors Cunliffe, F.L.Lucas, and Kastner and  Charlton. There is not \n              much  that can here be added except to say that it was probably greater than even the \n              numerous  identifiable pilferings and paraphrases would seem to indicate. Besides the \n              unquestionable responsibility for the five-act division of the modern European tragedy, \n              it is perhaps not exaggerating to claim for Seneca that the development of blank verse \n              as a vehicle of the English drama, instead of the old fourteener or the heroic couplet, \n              received considerable support from its being obviously the nearest equivalent to the \n              solemnity and weight of the Senecan iambic. That not only the \u201cTragedy of Blood\u2019 but \n              its concomitant, Elizabethan bombast and stichomythia, are Senecal, and that perhaps \n              the most  important and  certainly most pervading influence of Seneca was upon the \n              \u2018thought\u2019 {ta of the Elizabethans. \n                As to whether this influence was exerted directly or through these translations would \n              be difficult to determine, and indeed must have varied considerably with the different \n\n                  HfFive of the seven are in this collection. \n                  \u00a7The entry, which  also includes the Octavia, states that both \u2018tragides\u2019 were translated \u2018oute of the laten \n                    into englesshe by T W  fellowe of Pembrek  Hall in Chambryge\u2019. The  \u201cT W\u2019 is almost certainly an error \n                    for TN   , not, however, by Arber for Collier (Ex\u00e9racts p.147) gives the same reading. Thomas Nuce (or \n                    Newce)  according to Venn  (Alumni  cantabrigiensis ILI p.246) was a Fellow of Pembroke, 1562, and his \n                    Octaxia was published  by Denham,  without date, see below. \n                  jalt is possible that Denham actually published the Hippolytus and Hercules Oetaeus, as he did the Octauia, \n                    but if so they have not  survived and, even as early as 8th January 1584 (Arber  11.789) Denham  was \n                    somewhat   vague  about them  for at that time  he \u2018yielded for the use of the poor of the Company\u2019 \n                    his rights in \u2018Two or three of Seneca his Tragedies\u2019. It may also be noted that of the ten other books \n                    which he yielded at that time there were several whose copyright he had acquired from Seres (but with- \n                    out recording the transfer) and of which he is not known to have himself published any edition. \n                  faSeveral of the original proprietors were, by 1581, dead or out of business. There is no record of their \n                    transfer of the copyright of these books, but, as noted above, Denham,   at least, considered the two \n                    translations which he had entered in 1566-7 as still his property in 1584. \n                   taCf.

A variant, apparently a later state, of the Epilogue is laid in. \n\n                              THE  two  states of the epilogue are merely typographical variants. In what appears to \n                              be the earlier, the third line of the heading is in the same size type as the first, and the \n                              brackets which  mark the 9-11th and 26-28th lines are set at the end of the letterpress. \n                               In the other, these matters have been altered, line 3 of the heading is in larger type \n                              and  the brackets are moved far to the right. \n                                 According  to the dedication, this comedy of humours   was a  failure on the stage \n                              because it showed up the \u2018crying sin of Keeping\u2019.

This is a \u2018good\u2019 text and may very possibly be from the author\u2019s manuscript. \n                                 From internal evidence this edition follows that of 1611, from which it was printed, \n                              and  precedes that of 1637. The  date is generally given as circa 1630, but as there \n                              appears} to have been a revival of this play about 1619, as there was in 1637, and as \n                              in the latter year an edition was published it is not unlikely that the present should \n                              have been  brought forth by reason of the 1619 revival. At any rate the earlier date has \n                              the support of a formulable reason while \u2018c.1630\u201d is pure conjecture. \n                                 Copies of the earlier editions are rare in private hands; of the first, 1603, a copyt is \n                              listed in the Cat. of Printed Books at Middle Hill 1847, p.42, n.3084; of the second edi- \n                              tion there is the Verulam copy of the second issue, 1605, on exhibition in the Bodleian; \n                              while of the third edition, 1611, the Cope-Jones copy now belongs to the estate of the \n                              late C.W.Clark  and the Vernon-Holford  copy to the Rosenbach   Company. \n                                 Fifteen other copies of the present can be located, only one in a private collection, \n                              viz. the Bodleian (Malone), Boston Public (Barton, imperfect), British Museum  (Gar- \n                              rick; George  III), Elizabethan Club  (Huth), Folger  (Halliwell; Warwick;  Wolfres- \n                              ton-Halliwell-Harford), Harvard  (Crawford-White),  Huntington   (Roxburghe-Devon- \n\n                                     {Chambers  W.Shakespeare 11 p.346. \n                                     }It is probable that it is no longer there but is the copy now in the British Museum having been stolen \n                                       from Sir Thomas  Phillipps by Halliwell and placed in the Dublin auction where it is said to have first \n                                       appeared.

There was really little choice for both quartos present an exceedingly \n                                corrupt  text which is now, happily, superceded by the Folio version. \n                                   The copyright  in this play belonged to Pavier who obtained  it by private transfer \n                                 from the publishers of the  first edition, presumably Thomas   Millington  and  John \n                                 Busby though  Thomas  Creede, also, may have had  some rights in it as he printed both \n                                 the first and second editions, see Titus Andronicus 1611. Pavier registered his copy- \n                                 right, 14th August 160off, though a staying order, apparently for this play, had been \n                                 registered, 4th August [16002] (Arber III.37). Since Jaggard issued the present edition, \n                                presumably   with the full consent of Pavier, it is difficult to account for the title date \n                                 \u20181608\u2019, except by the fact that it was due to carelessness in Jaggard\u2019s printing shop \n                                 which allowed the false date of the King Lear [q.v.] title to be left in the chase and \n                                 shifted to the present position for this title. An alternative, but a not very attractive \n                                 explanation is that there was a 1608 edition known   to Jaggard  which  has now  dis- \n                                 appeared. \n\n                                       +Kinnear sold his books en d/oc to Thomas Thorpe, the bookseller, who listed them in his 1835 catalogue, \n                                         Pt. IV. \n                                       This  is a curious circumstance since it would seem to indicate that even in 1619, copies of the first edition \n                                         were more  easily obtainable than those of the second. Their relative scarcity, for some reason, has been \n                                         maintained  to this day. \n                                       HtAt the same time he registered eleven other titles the rights to which he had acquired from various former \n                                         owners  among  whom  were Creede, William White, John  Danter, Ralph  Blore and William  Barley. \n\n[ 912 ]\n\nOver  forty copies of this edition can be  traced, although of the first edition only \n                   seven, and of the second  only three copies are recorded. \n\n                    S.T.C. 22291.

Since Professor \n                  Alexander\u2019s papers in the 7.Z.S. in the autumn of 1924, scholars have been compelled \n                  to relinquish the earlier theories of authorship and revision which denied Shakespeare\u2019s \n                  authorship of the original play. \n\n                     TA  portion of his library was sold at Sotheby\u2019s 21 March 1932. \n\n             VOL.III                         [ 913 ]\n\nThis edition formed the first section of the Jaggard-Pavier collection of 1619.

That the text of this play is, if anything, superior to that of \n                               The  First Part of the Contention 1594, may have been due to the fact that the reporter \n                               had  seen it performed more recently than the other. \n                                 Only  one copy of the first edition, 1595, of this play is known: the Pegge-Chalmers \n                               in the Bodleian.

The present title, \n                                however,  is very pleasing in design and may well be pointed out as one of the best of \n                                the period and certainly the finest of any early Shakespeare quarto. \n                                   The text of this edition is based on that of the first quarto, and was in turn the basis \n                                of the Folio text. It is a \u2018good\u2019 text and may have been originally derived from Shake- \n                                speare\u2019s manuscript. The  copyright in this play belonged to Thomas  Fisher, or to his \n                                estate, but was probably derelict at the time of this edition for no transfer appears ever \n                                to have  been madet. \n                                   Of the first edition, 1600, no copy appears to be in private hands for the Bunbury- \n                                 Devonshire-Huntington  copy  is in the W.A.Clark Library  and the  White copy  is at \n                                 Harvard. Of the present over thirty copies have been located of which some half-dozen \n                                are still in private collections. This copy is, however, one of the finest. \n\n                                        {The only other title entered by Fisher was Marston\u2019s Antonio and  Mellida {q-v-] which he registered in \n                                          partnership with Matthew  Lownes, His rights in that play were also apparently allowed to lapse although \n                                          Thomas   Lownes maintained  his father\u2019s part of the copyright. \n\n                                  S.T.C. 22303.

The 23rd August 1600, Wise and Aspley made an entry \n                 for it also, possibly by transfer though this is not specified. It has been suggested some- \n                 what plausibly that the agent for the players was James Roberts who was connected \n                 with other similar ventures (see Troilus 1609). \n                   The  present edition presents a \u2018good\u2019 text which was employed by the editors of the \n                 first Folio. A passage was inserted in the text on recto G, apparently after the imposi- \n                 tion of that forme, which has crowded the page considerably. \n                   Fifteen other copies of this book can be located, viz.

Under James, however, that scene could  safely be \n                                  printed and,  accordingly it was introduced  into the edition of 1608, some copies of \n                                  which  bear a cancel title calling attention to the addition. \n\n                                         There  is a tradition that this is the Roxburghe copy but as it does not have any mark of his Grace\u2019s owner \n                                           ship and since only one copy is listed in his sale, it is improbable that this is a discarded duplicate for it is \n                                           larger and finer than the Huntington copy which has the Roxburghe stamp. \n\n[ 922 ]\n\nWith: \n                 : ith New \n\n                                iameng   Mitions  of \n                                 \u201cPoling of Kin Be, and th \n\nthe",

Praetorius facsimile), while in others there is not. \n              Copies of both states are in the Bodleian. \n                The copyright in this play apparently still remained in the possession of Joyce Norton \n              Law, the widow  of both  John Norton  the first and Matthew  Law. John  Norton, the \n             printer and apparently  publisher of the present, was perhaps the son of Bonham Nor- \n              ton, Plomer Wills p.46, and  therefore the nephew of the first husband of the owner \n             of the copyright. \n                The present  is much the largest copy of this edition recorded. Its condition, being \n             just as it was originally issued, totally uncut and with only the slightest of stitching, is \n\n          VOL.III                          [ 923 ]\n\nexceedingly uncommon   for an early Shakespeare quarto}. It is not just that this copy \n                            is in a condition likely to arouse the cupidity of collectors that makes it of considerable \n                            interest, but rather because it is just as the original purchaser obtained it for a \u2018testerne\u2019 \n                            (see Troilus 1609). \n                              We  have  located twenty copies of this edition of which only four others are still in \n                            private collections, viz. the Mostyn-Jones-C.W.Clark, the Utterson-Corser-Kershaw- \n                            \u2018Adams-Hogan,  the Clawson  copy now  in the possession of the Rosenbach  Company, \n                            and the Crichton  Stuart copy. The White copy  is at Harvard. \n\n                                   {There were three so-called \u2018uncut\u2019 early quartos in the Bindley sale (all reappeared in the Heber sales) \n                                     two of which (L.Z.L. 1598, and M.#\u201d.W.  1602) are now in the British Museum while the third (.N.D. \n                                     1600) is in the Elizabethan Club. But these copies, though very fine, are neither totally uncut nor in \n                                     \u2018original wrappers? as they have been described for they bear every mark of having once  been bound \n                                     together and their wrappers are bookseller\u2019s, made of eighteenth century marbled paper. \n                                       The  Ives copy of M.W.W.  1619, was catalogued as \u2018in the original paper covers\u2019 but whether that was \n                                     once correct it is no longer so, for the volume (afterwards in the Trowbridge and Glemby collections and \n                                     now  belonging to the estate of the late Darwin P. Kingsley) has been bound and its measurements preclude \n                                     any possibility that it is uncut. \n                                        We can find records of seven other early quartos which have been described as uncut but all have been \n                                     placed in modern bindings and so are not to be compared with the present. However, there are two others, \n                                     both  in the Folger Library, which  are somewhat  comparable,  viz. the Wolfreston-Halliwell-Harford \n                                     Hamlet  [c.1619], which is stabbed and uncut though a leaf has presumably been supplied from another \n                                     copy  while the title is soiled and there are damp-stains throughout; and the Palmer-Fenn-Chaloner \n                                     Smith-Perry  Pericles 1609, which is stitched together with  Daniel\u2019s Queenes Arcadia  1606 in what \n                                     appears  to be an original wrapper but its edges are severely cropped. \n                                        Besides these there are the two uncut sheets of Richard III, 1597, in the Elizabethan Club and several \n                                     uncut  and unbound  copies of the spurious plays can be traced, mainly in the Folger Library. \n\n                              $.7.C. 22313.

John \n             Danter  made  the original entry (6 February 1594, Arber 11.644) and the first quarto \n             bears the imprint \u2018 . . . by John Danter, and are to be sold by Edward  White  and \n             Thomas   Millington . . . \u2019. But that first entry includes, besides the \u2018book\u2019, i.e. the \n             play, of Titus Andronicus, a ballad of the same. Despite the fact that Pavier\u2019s 1602 \n             entry declares it to be a \u2018booke\u2019 which he is registering and despite the transfer by his \n             widow  (4 August  1626,  Arber IV.164-5) to Edward   Brewster and Robert  Birde of \n             \u2018Tytus and Andronicus\u2019}  the imprints of the extant quartos and ballads would seem to \n             indicate that White and Millington divided privately Danter\u2019s copyright, White taking \n             the play and Millington the ballad. \n               The  present is the earliest edition of which a copy remains in private hands. The \n             first edition, 1594, is known by the Folger copy alone; while of the second only the \n             Edinburgh  University (Drummond)    and the Huntington  (Bridgewater) copies are re- \n             corded. Of the present edition seventeen other copies can be traced, all but six are in \n             public collections, viz. Bodleian (Malone), Boston Public (Barton, imperfect), British \n             Museum   (Garrick and George  III, both imperfect), C.W.Clark (Cope-Jones), Crichton \n             Stuart, Elizabethan Club (Daniel-Huth), Folger (Howe; Kemble-Devonshire-Hunting- \n             ton; another, imperfect), Harvard (Perkins-White), Huntington (Church), Rosenbach \n             Co.

In the \n                               present that title-leaf is cancelled and the half-sheet, signed {], substituted. \n                                  In the second issue title, the statement that this play had been acted at the Globe \n                               is omitted and the author of the preface declares that it was \u2018neuer stal\u2019d with the Stage, \n                               neuer  clapper-clawd  with the palmes  of the  vulger\u2019. Consequently  Shakespearean \n                               scholars have been considerably puzzled by the fact that there is some external evidence \n                               that before this edition was printed the play was known \u2018and if known,  it must have \n                               been  performed\u2019. It has been suggested that it was only acted at Court, or at an Inn \n                               of Court, and  that \u2018this was not thought to amount to staling with the stage\u2019 (Alex- \n                               ander, Trans. 1X,  1928, p.267). \n                                  The only other early Shakespeare quarto to be furnished with a preface is the 1622 \n                                Othello (q.v.]. The present preface has been frequently quoted as authority for the \n                               price of quarto plays at that time, namely  a \u2018testerne\u2019, sixpence, while the singular \n                               prophecy  which it contains \u2018that when hee is gone, and his Commedies out of sale, you \n                               will scramble for them, and set vp a new English Inquisition\u2019 has been fulfilled if not \n                               exactly in the manner  the writer imagined. \n                                  The history of the copyright of this book is somewhat obscure. James Roberts first \n                               entered it, 7 February 1603, \u2018to print when he hath gotten sufficient aucthority for yt.\u2019 \n                                Roberts, apparently through his connections with the players by reason of his patent \n                               for play-bills, made several similar entries of plays. Whether these entries were intended \n                               as has been suggested, to forestall piracies or whether Roberts, who was a trade-printer \n                               and  not a publisher, merely speculated in the manuscripts which he was able through \n\n                                       +The uncut  Heber-Holford-Rosenbach   Co. copy of the first issue measures 82 x 6 inches or more than an \n                                         inch taller than the next tallest copy known. \n\n[ 926 ]\n\nhis connections to acquire, cannot be determined. In the Present instance, he appar- \n               ently did nothing about  it for some time. In 1606, Roberts sold his printing office to \n               William  Jaggard but  he did not apparently sell all his copyrights at that time. It is \n               therefore not unlikely that when, 28 January  1609, Bonian and  Walley entered this \n               play they were actually merely  registering a transfer of rights which they had legiti- \n               mately acquired  along with the unlicensed copy from Roberts. Perhaps the fact that \n               Roberts's entry was conditional while theirs was fully licensed was thought to be reason \n               enough for not noting the transfer. \n                 This quarto presents a \u2018good\u2019 text. Scholars are, of late years, inclining to the belief \n               that the Folio was set-up from a corrected copy of this edition. \n                 Of the first issue only four copies are known, viz. the British Museum (Steevens- \n               Roxburghe-George   III), Elizabethan Club (Daniel-Huth), Huntington  (Dyson-Pope- \n               Kemble-Devonshire),   and  the Heber-Holford  copy  now  owned  by  the Rosenbach \n               Company.   Of this second  issue we can trace nine other  copies, viz. the Bodleian \n               (Malone), British Museum   (Halliwell), Dyce, Eton (Storer), Folger (Locker-Church- \n              Huntington-Jones),   Harvard  (Perkins-White), Huntington  (Ives-Pope-Hoe), Trinity \n              College Cambridge   (Capell), and one in the Possession of the Crichton Stuart family. \n\n               S.T.C, 22332,  ARBER  III. 226; 400.

As to the identity of the other, and especially as to whether or not it is \n                                 Shakespeare\u2019s, there is little agreement. However, metrical tests show that it could be \n                                his, and the fact that no other dramatist is believed to have been capable of the poetic \n                                heights of the invocations is gradually influencing learned opinion. \n                                   The manuscript  from which  this was printed was annotated by a prompter  and some \n                                of his notes are preserved in this text. Copies of this edition, the only quarto edition \n                                published  and the basis of the 1679 Beaumont  and  Fletcher folio text, exhibit several \n                                variant readings.

This is of interest if only for the fact \n              that it gives Pemell\u2019s address, hitherto unrecorded, however, Pemell used that address \n              the  preceding year  in the imprint  of Mathew   Parker\u2019s The legend of Sir Leonard \n              Lack-wit. \n                 A great deal has been written, but very little proved, concerning the authorship of \n              this play. It was first attributed to Shakespeare by Edward Jacob in 1770, but, though \n              there have been several eloquent supporters, notably Swinburne, of that belief, scholars \n               now generally give it scant attention. W.J.Lawrence pointed out (7.L.S. 28 June 1934) \n               that the copy of this play in the Monro sale, 1792, apparently was either a variant or \n               an inscribed copy in which the authorship of this piece was attributed to one \u2018Cloy\u201d \n              or \u2018Clay\u2019. The importance  of this was commented  upon by Professor Oliphant (op. cit. \n               18 January  1936). \n                 The  first edition, 1592, is known by three copies, all in public collections; and the \n               second, 1599, also by  only three copies, the Bridgewater  and the Wright-Kemble- \n               Devonshire, both  in the Huntington  Library and  the Byng-Heber-Holgate-Britwell- \n               Folger copy. Of the present some twenty-odd  copies can be traced. They exhibit small \n               variations of no authenticity, for this edition is most corrupt. \n\n               Noted by Dr.Greg. \n\n               S.T.C. 735. Anser  IV. 120.

The arrangements dis- \n                    cussed by Madan   (he  Original Bodleian First Folio 1905, pp.10-12) assume that the title and catalogue \n                    leaves are conjugate, whereas from the evidence of the watermarks in all the copies we have examined that \n                    is impossible. Moreover, as may be seen in the case of Favyn\u2019s Theatre of Honour and Knight-hood which \n                    was printed in the same shop in the same year as the present and in which the title similarly involved the \n                    use of double-impression, the difficulty was overcome by printing the title on an inserted leaf as may be \n                   clearly seen in several copies of Favyn\u2019s book still in original condition, \n\n[ 933 ] \n\n             VOL.IIL\n\nand  Life, verses, signed \u2018HVGH HOLLAND\u2019,        \u2018The Names  of the Principall Actors, in italic, \n                                  recto [As]; verso blank; To the memorie,  two   recto  second; verso  blank;  A  Catalogue,  in \n                                  sets of verses in italic, signed \u2018L.Digges.\u2019 and _ italic, recto [A6]; verso blank. \n                                  \u2018LM.    recto first unsigned leaf; verso blank; \n                                     [Comptes]   text, pp.1-303; blank, p.[304].

It was originally intended to be set-up following Romeo and Juliet \n                                        but was withdrawn, probably because of difficulties regarding copyright, and only included in the volume \n                                        when  it was too late to be noted in the Catalogue or to be paged as part of the Tragedies.

The  Boccaccio  has the same  kind of \n                                        end-papers (marbled) and headbands  (not Payne\u2019s colors) as the present.

It is not unlikely that some copies were actually \n                                        issued before it was prepared and one can easily cite a half-dozen copies, otherwise complete, which lack \n                                        it. However, the matter cannot be proven unless an unsophisticated copy in original binding should be \n                                        discovered which was  imperfect in that respect, The ten copies known in seventeenth-century calf are \n                                        all, for one reason or another, not of assistance in the solution of this problem. \n\n                                     SeThese  leaves are from a copy belonging to Quaritch which was damaged by a fire at Riviere\u2019s. \n\n[ 934 ]\n\n\u00ab33. \n\n                 Two  copies only are known,  the Morgan  (Brownloe)  and Folger (Burdett-Coutts), \n               which have  the original leaf, Sig gg3, containing on recto, numbered \u201877\u2019, the last page \n               of Romeo  and Juliet and on  verso the first page of Troilus and Cressida.

They then reprinted, from a new setting, \n               the last page of Romeo and Fuliet and introduced Timon of Athens in the place originally \n               intended for Troilus and Cressida. However, after the list of contents had been printed, \n               the obstacles which  prevented the  publication of Troilus were removed  and it was \n\n                  jaTrhere are about 200 recorded copies, of which nearly 80 are in the Folger Library and so like most of the \n                    other known   copies, no longer available to collectors. Though relatively numerous, however, copies are \n                    not often in very good condition and there can be no doubt that, all points considered, this copy would \n                    rank  among  the first score. \n                  4A   striking example may be seen in the page of proof discovered by Halliwell-Phillipps, later in the Huth \n                    and  Folger Libraries. \n                  {4eTThe copyright in 7. and C. belonged at that time to Henry Walley (Arber TII.400).

Two of the settings of the outer forme \n               were  altered while the type was standing: the second setting once, and the third five \n               times. The  present copy represents the second variant of the third setting of the title, \n               and  the third setting of the two poems}. \n                  The five variations of the third setting of the title differ only in the imprint. In the \n               earliest the imprint reads as in the present except that the words \u2018at his fhop\u2019 do not \n               occur. The  present has them inserted. The other three variations substitute for Allot\u2019s, \n               the names  and addresses of the four other publishers listed in the colophon. These pub- \n               lishers were all proprietors of one or more of the copyrights in Shakespeare\u2019s plays{t \n               but  their interests were much  less than Allot\u2019s and consequently the proportion  of \n               copies issued with  their names  in the imprint was  much  smaller than his with  the \n               natural result that such copies are now relatively rare. \n                  The three settings of the Effigies leaf may be distinguished by the fact that the word \n               \u2018passions\u2019 in the sixth line of the first poem differs typographically. The first reads \n               \u2018pafsions\u2019; the second  \u2018paffions\u2019; and the third \u2018pafsions\u2019, with ligatured double-s \n               (present). \n                  Professor Smith lists twenty-four other copies in this country, not including those \n               in the Folger Library, of the present combination  of title and Effigies, and there are \n               doubtless twice that number   in existence. \n\n                  fUntraced  in his sale, Sotheby\u2019s 1903. \n                  tFor detailed analysis see op. laud. \n                  tin  1632  the copyright of M. of . belonged to Laurence Hayes, that of King Lear to Nathaniel Butter, \n                    of \u00a3. and C. to Henry  Walley, Richard II, Richard I1I and I Henry IV were presumably the property of \n                    Thomas   Warren, while I and IT Henry VI  were possibly now derelict besides the two already so in 1623. \n                     \u2018The large interest held by Thomas and Richard Cotes, viz. the share formerly belonging to Jaggard plus \n\n                    Henry V, 1.A. and Hamlet, was probably represented by Thomas Cotes. \n\n[ 937 ] \n\n              VOL.III\n\nThis is the edition of which Prynne complained that it was printed on the best crown \n                             paper. \n\n                                                                                          W.A.CLaRK \n\n                                 S.T.C, 22274.

Text, in two columns,  box-ruled). \n\n[ 938 ]\n\nTue  title of this issue is known in two states: in one, the Droeshout portrait (third \n                 state) which had been used in the earlier editions is introduced between the fifth line \n                 and the imprint. In the other, that space is left blank, e.g. the present. Whether the \n                plate was left out in some copies because it could not be found and the publication was \n                 thereby being delayed, or whether because its condition made it a questionable orna- \n                ment,  cannot be determined. \n                   For notes regarding second issue see next number. \n                   The printing of this edition was evidently divided among three shops. Roger Daniel \n                printed quires A-E,  I-Z, Gg-Aaa, and  Ppp-Eeee; another printed quires F-H, Aa-Ff, \n                 and Iii-Ooo; while Alice Warren  printed quires Bbb-Hhh. Though   Chetwind\u2019s name \n                 alone appears on the title, he was not, apparently, the sole proprietor of the copyrights \n                involved  for Eleanor  Cotes,  Miles Flesher, William Leake,  John  Martin, Gabriel \n                 Bedell, Thomas  Collins and Alice Warren owned some  of them at the time of publica- \n                 tion while six plays were apparently then derelict. \n                   This edition has always been  thought to be the rarest of the seventeenth century \n                 folio editions but no authoritative figures are available. In any case, copies of this first \n                issue are certainly less common than those of the second judging by the auction records \n                alone. The legend, for the address of Chetwind\u2019s shop before 1666 is not known, that a \n                large proportion of the copies of this edition were destroyed in the Great Fire would \n                seem  to be substantiated by the records, though unless the sale immediately after pub- \n                lication was very slow or the alteration in the title was made before many copies were \n                issued one would naturally expect the later issue to be the one burned in the warehouse. \n\n                  CuurcH  Cat.

The Hagen  (1918, Lot 1076) copy \n                 with Hagen  and  White  Wallingwells bookplates. Inscribed on title \u2018Hen: Eyre: pret 148:8d:\u2019. \n\n               THERE  are two settings of the title of this edition and of the present there is a variant. \n               In the latter Chiswell\u2019s name and address is omitted from the imprint which reads: \n               \u2018LONDON,    | Printed for H.Herringman,  E.Brewster, and R.Bently, at the Anchor in \n               the | New Exchange, the Crane in St. Pauls Church-Yard, and in | Ruffel-Street Covent- \n               Garden. 1685. |\u2019. \n                 The other setting, e.g. next number, has no period after \u2018M\u00ae\u2019 in first line of title; a \n               colon replaces the period after \u2018Folio\u2019; single brackets are substituted for the outline \n              ones;  the device is replaced by a block of type-ornament;  and  the imprint reads: \n               \u2018LONDON,    | Printed for H.Herringman,  and are to be fold by Yofeph Knight | and \n               Francis Saunders, at the Anchor in the Lower Walk  | of the New Exchange. 1685. |\u2019. \n               Knight and  Saunders were the agents to whom  Herringman  entrusted the retail side \n              of  his business so that that title probably appears on such copies as belonged  to \n               Herringman  as his share in this enterprise}. \n                 It has usually been statedt that the Knight and Saunders setting is the earlier. The \n              only evidence  which has been  adduced is that the sole advertisement of this edition \n              published in the Term  Catalogue (Arber 7.C. 11.130) has their names. Such reasoning \n              is specious for all that can be ascertained from that entry is that Knight and Saunders \n              advertised in that medium   while the others did not. It is probable that the two set- \n              tings were simultaneously issued and both titles were available on the same day. \n                 The copy  for this edition was divided among several shops. Some  miscalculation \n              apparently occurred  so that the equivalent of about one column of additional matter \n              had  to be crowded into Sig L which is therefore printed in a much smaller type than \n\n  \n\n               the rest of the volume. \n\n                  + By 1685 the Stationers\u2019 Register is no longer very useful for tracing transfers of copyright and the respective \n                    shares owned  by the four booksellers whose names occur in the imprint cannot be defined. However, it \n                    should be noted  that Robert Scott at the time owned a considerable moiety, cf.

Moreover, as most pages have 37 lines, apparently \n                             on  verso C3-recto [C4] a passage was added  after the outer forme of that sheet was \n                              imposed and perhaps  printed off, for in some copies there are 38 lines on verso C3 and \n                             39 on recto [Ca]. In that state recto [C4] is crowded, line 34, for example, running over \n                              into line 35, so that while that forme was in the press the crowding was  relieved\u2014 \n                              the first line recto [C4], \u2018Infernall Spirits, . . .\u2019, was transferred to the bottom of \n\n[ 950 ]\n\nverso C3, and recto [C4], though still having 39 lines, is less crowded than before, while \n                verso C3 has 39  lines also, e.g. the present.

From  Shakespeare  Library \n                               (11, 1918, Lot 312). This book was at one time in the Hoe library and has Robert Hoe\u2019s initials, \n                               and  bears traces of his bookplate. \n\n                           \u2018Tuoveu  it is now somewhat difficult to understand the occasion for the strong feelings \n                           which the publication of Prynne\u2019s Histriomastix aroused, there can be no doubt of their \n                           existence. It was felt by Whitehall that if the gentlemen of the Inns of Court should \n                           present a masque before the king and queen it might be a gesture which would be most \n                           effective as an answer to the puritan agitation. In the MSS. of Earl Cowper (Historical \n                           MSS.  Com.  App. to Twelfth Report 11, 34) there is a letter from Thomas Coke, dated \n                           17th October 1633, which records \u2018There came a desire for [sic] the King about a fortnight \n                           ago to the Inns of Court by my Lord Keeper  that the gentlemen of the several Inns \n                           would show  themselves at Court by the presentation of a mask, which desire was sud- \n                           denly accepted and speedily concluded upon\u2019. In order to show their contempt for the \n                           opponents of the stage, the Inns of Court presented this mask with the most ostenta- \n                           tious magnificence. It is said that upwards of \u00a321,000 was lavished in its production \n                           (Whitelocke\u2019s Memorial of the Eng. Affairs ed.1853, 1, 53-62). According to a note on \n                           p-24 of this edition, Inigo Jones designed the scenery (Simpson & Bell Designs by \n                           Inigo Jones for Masques &  Plays at Court pp.79-82) and William Lawes  and Simon \n                           Ives composed the music. In Francis Lenton\u2019s The Innes of Court anagrammatist 1634, \n                           the names of the masquers are given on verso of the title. \n                             The  magnificence and timeliness of this masque probably excited a great deal of \n                           public interest in it} so that the publisher anticipated a large sale of the description and \n                           text for which, in order to forestall pirated editions, he made an early entry in the \n                           Stationers\u2019 Register. It also appears that in order to meet the demand he had the text \n                           of the volume set-up in duplicatef which accounts for the fact that the several states \n                           and settings of the sheets are found in various combinations having been gathered \n                           indiscriminately. Hence, though the order of these states, and perhaps also the order of \n                           the settings, or some of them, might be determined it would be futile to try to designate \n                           a given copy as earlier than another. \n\n                                   TCf. letter from Privy Council to Lord Mayor (Remembrancia  VII. 106, reprinted Malone  Society Collections \n                                      Ii, 99) making extraordinary requests that the streets be cleaned and special precautions taken to preserve \n                                     order on  the occasion of the presentation of this masque. \n                                   {Still another \u2018edition\u2019 is known. It reads on the title \u2018The third Impreffion,\u2019 and is further distinguished \n                                      by a passage added on p.3; while on p.to, one has been deleted (Ashley Cat. V, 162). That \u2018edition\u2019 was \n                                     probably  published to meet the continuing demand  after the large original printing had been disposed of \n                                      and affords evidence that that \u2018edition\u2019 was set-up in duplicate. \n\n[ 960 ]\n\nIn the following tablet} derived from an examination  of nearly a dozen copies the \n               asterisk indicates the state found in the present. \n               1. The  preliminary half-sheet is known  in only one setting\u00a7 but with two  states. In \n                  what  was presumably   the first, the thirteenth to fifteenth lines of the title read \u2018By \n\n                 yames  Shirley, Gent. | [rule] | \u2014 \u2014 Primum | Hunc Arethufa mihi. \u2014 \u2014 |\u2019; whereas \n                 in the later* they read \u2018By James Shirley, of Grayes Inne, | Gent. | [rule] | Primum hunc \n                 Arethufa mihi\u2014  |\u2019. This alteration was probably occasioned by the author\u2019s desire \n\n                  that it should be known   that he was  a member  of one of the societies which pre- \n                  sented the masque   and not a mere hired hack. At some  time during the printing of \n                  this half-sheet the \u2018a\u2019 in the word \u2018and\u2019 in the first line of verso a2 worked loose \n                  and  was replaced by  the printer with an \u2018o\u2019. \n                 . Sheet A occurs in two settings distinguished by the position of the signature on recto \n                  of first leaf. In one, it is below and between the first and second letters of the word \n                  \u2018hand\u2019; in the other%, it is below and to the right of the period following that word. \n                  In this latter setting the two formes are known in uncorrected and corrected states; \n                  the outer  forme having  the catchword, verso A2, incorrect and correct;  the inner \n                   forme, p.2 line 19, reads \u2018bride\u2019 and \u2018bridle\u2019* (corrected). The alterations in these \n                  formes  were not made  at the same  time. \n                3. Sheet B occurs in two settings distinguished by the position of the signature on recto \n                  of the first leaf. In one, it is below \u2018er\u2019 of \u2018Hermophrodite\u2019; in the other, under \n                  the first \u2018o\u2019. The former of these settings appears in two states; in the earlier it is \n                  without  a catchword,  verso [Bg]; in the later it has the catchword \u2018Ma-\u2019\u2014the type \n                  has been  somewhat   loosened in making the alteration. \n                4. Sheet C occurs in two settings, both known in two states. In one* setting, p.15 line 1, \n                  reads \u2018Swifly  . . . \u2019; in the other, \u2018Swiftly . . . \u2019. The earlier state of the \u201cSwifly\u2019 \n                  setting lacks the line \u2018This Chariot . . . \u2019 above the heading to Song 3.; the later, \n                  has  it. The earlier state of the \u2018Swiftly\u2019 setting lacks the stage direction \u2018A Land- \n                  fchape  . . . \u2019, verso C; the later has it. \n                s. The outer forme of sheet D occurs in two settings and the inner in three. That sheet \n                  is found  with all six possible combinations. One setting of the outer forme  has a \n                  swash  italic signature \u2018D\u2019, whereas the other has plain italic. The three settings of \n                  the  inner forme are differentiated in the first five lines of p.18. In one, these lines \n                  are in roman   type; in another,  in italic and line 1 reads\u2018. . . Wings,\u2019; while in \n                   the other they are also in italic but line 1 reads * . wings.\u2019 \n\nvp \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n                    HSince  it is not possible to give reproductions of the variant settings and states it is perhaps well to note \n                      that considerable care has been  taken to distinguish, by examination of type, diagonal measurements, \n                      signature-positions, etc., between genuine resettings and mere alterations made while the formes were \n                      in the press or standing. In this analysis, however, only one distinguishing mark is given for each variety. \n                    \u00a7lt is a curious fact that this half-sheet is known in only one setting for one would naturally suppose that it \n                      would  be set-up in duplicate in preference to any other part of the work. The only plausible explanation \n                      is that, as was customary, this portion of the volume was the last to be set-up and the printer found that \n                      he could print sufficient copies of it to Keep up with the sale of the book without going to the trouble \n                      of setting it again, \n\n                 S.T.C. 22459.

The  present, published by \n               Olney  as dn apologie for poetrie, collates A-L\u2018, while the other, published by William \n               Ponsonby  under  the title The defence of poetrie, collates [-]', B-K2 in fours. They are \n               quite independent textually being taken from entirely distinct manuscripts. A compar- \n               ison reveals a remarkable number of variant readings though none, except perhaps the \n               passage in the Defence of eleven lines, verso 13, lines 18-29, which does not appear in the \n               Apologie and several of the Latin quotations which are quite different in the two editions, \n               is of any great importance. \n                 Ponsonby,  who  appears to have had  direct relations with the literary executors of \n               Sidney, made  the first entry for this book, 29th November 1594, and presumably he \n               used what may  be termed an \u2018authorized\u2019 manuscript. However, it is unlikely, although \n               his entry was made more  than four months before that of Olney, 12th April 1595, that \n               Ponsonby  actually printed his edition first. In fact the Stationers\u2019 Court which granted \n\n             VOL.                            [ 963 ]\n\nOlney a license must have known nothing of Ponsonby\u2019s Defence except the title which \n                              not being the same they regarded as of a different work. Indeed Olney himself may \n                              have been ignorant of Ponsonby\u2019s prior rights for in the address prefixed to the present \n                              he intimates that this is the first printing. \n                                However,  Ponsonby  apparently did not long delay asserting his rights for Olney\u2019s \n                              entry is crossed out in the Register with the  following undated comment:   \u2018This \n                              belongeth to master ponsonby by a former entrance and an agreement is made between \n                              them whereby  Master Ponsonby is to enioy the copie according to the former entrance\u2019. \n                              Just what arrangement was made  between these two proprietors is, of course, largely a \n                              matter for conjecture but it appears to have included the transfer of such copies as \n                              remained unsold in Olney\u2019s hands to Ponsonby for at least two copies} are known which \n                              are made-up  from the sheets of the Apologie with a Ponsonby title prefixed. \n                                This treatise was written in reply to Stephen Gosson\u2019s abusive tracts which were \n                              impudently dedicated to Sidney himself. It appears to have been written in 1581, and \n                              consequently antedates most Elizabethan critical essays in support of poetry and the \n                              poets.

Whether these variations are related cannot be \n               definitely determined because only four copies are known in early, that is contemporary \n               or seventeenth century  bindings. If one were to take those as sufficient evidence, it \n               would seem  that copies may have either imprint with either state of verso Sig [Ag], and, \n               since these two variations occur in opposite formes of that sheet, that is as one might \n               suppose, @ priori, it would be. Likewise, it is rather difficult to determine which form of \n               the imprint is the earlier; probably that used in the present has the better claim to that \n               distinction. The note on verso [Ag], on the other hand, is very likely an addition. \n                  The story  of the printing of this romance has  been repeated numberless  times. \n               Suffice it to say that the text here given is the incompletely revised one which Sidney \n               had  left \u2018in trust\u2019 with his friend, Fulke Greville, who may have been the \u2018over-seer of \n               the print\u2019{ who, according  to the note on verso [A4], was responsible for \u2018. . . the \n               diuision and  summing  up  of the Chapters\u2019. Subsequent editions present a text rear- \n               ranged  and supplemented  both with new matter written by the Countess of Pembroke \n                and with portions of Sidney\u2019s earlier draftstt. \n                  Only  four other copies with this imprint can be traced: the Capell, Huntington \n              (Crossley-Sotheby\u2019s   1905-Halsey), C.T.Crocker (Hussey-Wallace),  and a copy now in \n                the hands of a London dealer (apparently the copy sold at Sotheby's in 1921). Of copies \n                with the other imprint at least eleven can be traced and there are doubtless others. \n                However,  despite these numbers the book is, considering its importance, a great rarity \n                in unsophisticated condition. \n\n                    {At  least two copies of this issue were at one time in Crossley\u2019s hands. \n                    {Frances  A.

However, there is a \n               copy  of this edition at Wadham   College, Oxford, which  is bound in an eighteenth \n               century binding with copies of the Toy issues of Philip Sparrow and Why come and the \n               Marshe   issue of Colin Clout which, possibly, indicates either that more copies of the \n               present were published than of the Kele editions or that this book is of a slightly later \n               date. \n                 One  of the pieces listed on the title, The deth of . . . Edwarde the fourth, is probably \n               spurious (cf. Brie Engl. Stud. XX XVII, p.27) but the volume contains four pieces, not \n               there listed, which, presumably, are genuine, viz. \u2018Howe euery thynge  must haue  a \n               tyme\u2019, \u2018Prayer to the father of heuyn\u2019, \u201cTo the seconde parson\u2019 and \u201cTo the holy goost\u2019. \n\n                   }The  edition ascribed to \u2018[R.Lant for H.

Until acquired by Henry  Huth  this \n                                book was  bound with two other Skeltons, viz. the Kele editions of Philip Sparrow and Why come \n                                \u2018ye not to court. The collection was subsequently broken and the three pieces uniformly boundtf. \n\n                            Tuer    is an earlier edition printed by Thomas Godfray (known  only  by the copy \n                            belonging to the Duke of Bedford preserved at Woburn Abbey) which, from the format \n                            and  the fact that the object of its satire died in 1530, near which time it was presumably \n                            issued, was probably  the earliest edition printed. It is possible that Godfray also \n                            printed editions of Philip Sparrow and Why come ye not to court although no copies are \n                            known. \n                               That Middleton  printed this book for Kele may be established by the evidence of \n                            the  types and ornaments.  The  date of printing may also be  defined as sometime \n                            between  1542, when Kele began publishing, and 1546, when he moved  from the \u2018long \n                            shop\u2019. \n                               Middleton also printed for Kele Philip Sparrow and Why come ye not to court (q.v.] \n                            apparently at about the same time as the present. The format of all three is similar and \n                            the same types and ornaments are found throughout. Probably Kele sold copies of the \n                            three pieces together for three such collections can be traced\u00a7, to wit, that of which the \n                            present once formed  a part, the Inglis-Tite-Locker-Hagen-Huntington which  is still \n                            intact, and a set which Freeling broke-up and had separately bound  and which has \n                            been reunited on the shelves of the British Museum, two volumes being in the Grenville \n                            collectionta and the two others having been acquired at the Corser sale. \n                               A third edition was printed for Wight and Marshe and a fourth for Kitson, Veale, and \n                            Walley. \n                               This poem  is a vigorous attack upon the clergy, towards the end upon the higher \n                            clergy as personified by Wolsey, whom Skelton blames for all the ills of England. \n                              Of the present only four other copies are recorded, viz. the British Museum (Freeling- \n                            Corser), Bodleian, Huntington (Inglis-Tite-Locker-Hagen), and the Hoe-Huntington- \n                            Clawson  copy which has not been traced. \n\n                                    $1Since the Huth sale the other two volumes have found their way to the Chapin Library. \n                                    \u00a7According to Dibdin, a set of the Kele issues is at Ham House.

When in the Stevens collection this book was bound with three other \n               works  by Skelton, viz. the Wight editions of Colin Clout and Way come ye not to court, and the \n                King edition of the Certayne bokes. These are now in the Huntington Library. \n\n               Tuts edition is known  by only two  copies\u2014the present and  the Bright copy in the \n               British Museum.   The latter differs from the present in the colophon which reads: \n               <2  Smprpnted at London in paules | ehurche perde by Zohn wpabt ft \n                 The ornamental  blocks as well as the type (Isaac-Copland Textura 95) indicate that \n               this edition was printed neither by Toy nor Wight but by William Copland for them. \n               The state of the blocks used on the title shows that this edition was printed before the \n               1554 edition of the Four Sons of Aymon, and, since the earliest date at which Wight is \n               known  to have been at work  is 1551, its production may be definitely limited to that \n               period of three or four years. \n                 Regarding  the possibility of an edition printed by Thomas Godfray see Kele\u2019s Colin \n               Clout. The Kele edition of Philip Sparrow, printed by Middleton, precedes the present \n               and the  Kitson-Veale-Walley edition, printed by John Day  (for the Walley issue see \n               next number)  follows it. \n                 Toy  and  Wight published  an edition of Why come ye not to court which is uniform \n               with the present in format, type, even to the same blocks on the title, and was appar- \n               ently printed at very nearly the same time. Bound  with various combinations of the \n\n                   tAccording  to the Sotheby cataloguers this was by Roger Payne but it was not separately bound until after \n                      Payne\u2019s death, The  tools used are found in books bearing Kalthoeber\u2019s ticket. \n\n          VOL.                      [971]\n\nissues of these two books, presumably at an early date, are found copies of an edition \n                             of Colin Clout printed for Wight and Marshe}. That edition, though uniform in size, \n                             type, and partly on paper of the same watermark, with the other two books, has the \n                             title within McKerrow and Ferguson Compartment   No.17, and  therefore superficially, \n                             at any rate, does not have the appearance of having been  originally intended to be \n                             issued with the others. If one could assume that copies of all the issues of all the edi- \n                             tions printed are extant some excuse for delay in printing the Colin Clout might be \n                             found in the fact that of the three books it is the only one preceded by an edition other \n                             than that of Kele [c.1545]tt. Following that reasoning, one would then be lead to the \n                             conclusion that the Wight and Marshe edition of the Colin Clout was printed after the \n                             death of Toy, early in 1556, when Marshe became  associated with Wight in the place \n                             left by Toy. However, though the internal evidence of the state of the title-compart- \n                             ment appears to support such a date, it must be recalled that at least one issue of each \n                             of the three editions is known by only one copy and that, therefore, it is entirely possi- \n                             ble, granted that they were all printed in 1554-5, that Marshe was associated with Toy \n                             and Wight  in printing all three of the books. \n                               Philip Sparrow is deservedly the most popular of all Skelton\u2019s poems. It is a burlesque \n                             lamentation, full of teasing magniloquence with the alliteration and the other Skeltoni- \n                             cal traits quite under control, for the death of a bird which belonged to Jane Scrope a \n                             pupil of the Black Nuns  at Carrow, near  Norwich. Though   the topic is similar to \n                             Catullus\u2019s dirge for Lesbia\u2019s sparrow, it owes less to that famous poem than to the \n                             mock  encomnia which were  the delight of Renaissance scholars of whom Skelton was \n                             one of the earliest in England, being celebrated by Erasmus in his De Laudibus Britan- \n                             niae as \u2018unum Britannicarum literarum lumen  ac decus\u2019. \n\n                                  }The only copy of the Marshe issue which can be traced is in Wadham College, Oxford. \n                                  ttViz. the octavo edition printed by Thomas Godfray about 1530, the only known copy of which is at \n                                    Woburn  Abbey. \n\n                                  S.T.C.

Doubtless during Wolsey\u2019s lifetime no printer would have had the courage to \n                                put this work into print but, afterwards, it may well have been issued more than once \n                                in editions which are no longer extant.

There are at least three cuttings which can be found in English printing, see \n                                           illustrations. The earliest belonged to Wynkyn de Worde who probably  copied it directly from Verard. \n                                           It may be recognized by the five lines sloping from left to right in ornament on cap. Another block was \n                                           used by R.Wyer  which may  be traced after the middle of the seventeenth century in a ballad printed by \n                                           F.Coules, Christmas lamentation (Roxburghe  Ballad No.48). It is a close copy of the de Worde  block \n                                           except that it has four dots instead of the five lines. Finally there is the cut used in the present. It may \n                                           be distinguished by the absence of the rosette, which occurs in the others, at the top of the gore-shaped \n                                           slash in the skirt. It was used sixteen times by Laurence Andrewe in his undated [15292] edition of The \n                                           myrrour of the worlde, \n                                         tThis cut was used by Pynson  in his editions of Skelton\u2019s Dyuers Balettys and Dyties and Agaynste a comely \n                                           Coystrowne.

The plates have their original deckle. \n\n                            Tue  printing of this book was divided between Dawson  and  Haviland, each printing \n                            three books\u2014 Haviland  began his stint with Sig P, while Dawson\u2019s part ended on verso \n                            N3. This miscalculation left a gap of five leaves, or ten pages. The omission of quire O \n                            apparently did not disconcert the printers but the fact that the final leaf of quire N, \n                            being blank, would be wasted probably  did disturb them for the printers of that time \n                            abhorred an odd  blank leaf as Nature does a vacuum. Haviland, therefore, printed on \n                            the blank, pp.95-6, commendatory  verses under the heading: \u2018Now seeing there is thus \n                            much  Paper here to spare, that you should not be altogether cloyed with Prose; such \n                            Verses as my worthy  Friends bestowed vpon New  England,  I here present you . . . \u2019 \n                            These verses are taken from Smith\u2019s Description of New England  1616. \n                              The  sheets comprising the text of this book were reissued five times with the date of \n                            the engraved title altered to 1625, 1626, 1627, 1631 and 1632. In the latest issue the \n                            publisher is given as Edward Blackmore, in place of Michael Sparke. In each reissue, \n                            alterations were made in some of the plates. From Wilberforce Eames\u2019s very elaborate \n                            analysis of the relationship of the states of these plates to the several issues it appears \n                            that although the title of this copy is in the earliest state, appropriate to a copy of the \n                            1624 issue, the plates belong, apparently, to the 1627 issue. It is therefore not unlikely \n                            that either the title or the maps are inserted from another issue although this copy \n                            may  be truthfully described as in fine condition. \n                              A slip containing six lines of errata occurs in a few copies pasted at the foot of page \n                            248. There are traces of paste at that point in this copy which indicate that it was once \n                            present. \n                              There  are large-paper copies of this book dated 1624. They were printed after the \n                            small-paper sheets were printed off since they contain all the press-corrections found \n                            in any small-paper copies. To print the large-paper issue the formes were reimposed \n                            with larger margins. Small-paper  copies in uncut state sometimes  measure  slightly \n                            more  than an inch taller than the present which is about the average size. The tallest \n                            large-paper copies recorded are slightly more than two inches taller than the present. \n\n                              S.T.C. 22790.  ARBER  IV. 121.

As books are known printed in 1609 \n                      with Windet\u2019s name  in their imprints and with ornaments which later passed to Stansby (e.g. Boethius \n                      Five Bookes . . .) it seems probable that the transfer was not made until 1610 (e.g. Corkine Ayres 1610, \n                      which contains Mc Kerrow  device No.292). \n\n                 S.T.C. 22862,   ARBER  III. 365.

It is possible that this was \n                           not done  by passing the sheet through the press a second time but by a hand-stamp. \n                            Copies of both issues are in the British Museum  (Garrick and  George III) and  the \n                            Huntington  Library (Bridgewater and Bliss-Chew). \n                              A very accurate facsimile of the present edition was made by J.Smeeton about 1815; \n                           a copy, the Percy  Fitzgerald, is in this collection. Like most copies it has the bottom \n                           margin  of the title torn off so that the imprint, \u2018J.Smeeton, Printer, St. Martin\u2019s Lane.\u2019, \n                           which  was at the bottom of the verso is obliterated. This facsimile is so well done that \n                           not  only was a copy sold in the McKee  Sale as the original (though later returned), \n                           but  F.S.Boas in his edition of Kyd\u2019s Works printed at the Oxford Press collated variant \n                           readings of it and did not discover the mistake until after his work was through the \n                           press. Moreover, Dr. Farmer unwittingly reproduced  the Smeeton  facsimile instead of \n                           the original in his Tudor Facsimile Reprints. However, with the double  check of the \n                            Boas variant readings and the Farmer  facsimile, there is now no need for confusion \n                           between  the Smecton  facsimile and the original, especially as, once warned, the type \n                           and  paper of the facsimile betray its date. \n                              This tragedy has been attributed, in whole or in part, to Kyd, Peele and Greene, \n                           but  the question is still open. \n                              Of the earlier issue there are at least nine copies, but of this second only five others: \n                            British Museum  (George III), Boston Public (Barton), Folger (Bridgewater duplicate- \n                            Heber), Huntington (Bliss-Chew), and the Jolley-Locker-Clawson  copy now owned  by \n                            L.C.Harper. \n\n                                    tIn the undated edition the first line on recto Ea, reads: \u2018That for retaining one fo vertuous,\u2019 (repeated from \n                                      outer forme being the last line on verso E2) which is meaningless especially since the catchword  on the \n                                      preceding page calls for the second line, In the present edition this unwanted line is omitted. \n\n                             S.T.C. 228954.

Evidently \n              after it had been set-up it was decided to omit a considerable portion of the contents \n              of sheet E which involved the re-imposition, if not the resetting, of all the text that \n              was retained, at least so far as Sig Er and 2 are concerned, see Trans.

It is not known  whether Chetwood   and \n                          Jauncy,  the rather obscure publishers, recovered their investment. However,  they \n                          evidently made  a determined attempt  for some copies, e.g. the Ashley, have printed \n                          on the title below the imprint \u2018(Price Eighteen-pence.)\u2019 which was rather high for such \n                          a piece at that time. It is not possible to decide whether such copies are earlier or later \n                          than those without the note of price. Both states are otherwise from the same setting \n                          except that in the present the space between the imprint  and the advertisement  is \n                          slightly reduced. \n                            The  copy  appears to have been  divided between  two compositors  at the end of \n                          sheet G. \n                            This tragedy, which is based on Plutarch\u2019s Life of Aegis, was written in 1684 at the \n                          request of the Duke of Berwick but laid aside as dangerous in subject. When produced \n                          and printed some four hundred lines were omitted as likely to give offence. The omitted \n                          passages are supplied in the present in an early hand, possibly the author\u2019s. They have \n                          in several places been trimmed by the binder. \n\n                             AsHLey  Cat. 1X, 130.  Wrenn   Cat. IV, 161.  Cox  Gosse Cat., 249.",

This text was not reprinted in the later \n                              English editions. \n                                The  present edition contains one poem, \u2018The  Christian Manna\u2019,  which  does not \n                              appear to have been previously printedf, or indeed to have been included in any of the \n                              early English editions. It is the earliest edition to have even the author's initials on the \n                              title, and since it appears to be quite independent of the English editions, it should \n                              properly be designated \u2018the first St.Omer edition\u2019 or \u2018the first collected edition\u2019. \n                                The  allusions to Shakespeare\u2019s Venus and Adonis and the application in an entirely \n                              different sense of a figure used in Love\u2019s Labours Lost which have been found in Saint \n                              Peters Complaint are without foundation in fact as was pointed out by  Signor Praz \n                              (M.L.R.  July 1924). \n                                Only three other copies are known, viz. the Huntington (Utterson-Gaisford-McKee- \n                              Chew),  the British Museum  (James  I), and the copy in original vellum, bound with \n                              St. Omer editions of S.T.C. 22948 and 23532, in the Harmsworth  Library. \n\n                                     +The  poem Saint Peters Peccaui had previously been printed in part as Davids Peccaui and in part as Sinnes \n                                       heauie load; 8.Mary Magdalens  Traunce as Lewd loue is losse; S.Mary Magdalens farewell as From Fortunes \n                                        Reach; 8.Peters Returne home as Looke Home; Saint Peters Comfort in part as Scorne not the least and in \n                                        part as Time goes by turnes; No Ioy to liue as What ioy to liue; and Saint Peters Wish as Life is but Losse. \n\n                                    S.T.C. 22963.

The \n                 Narcissus Luttrell-Pendarves (1936, Lot 162) copy. \n\n               ALTHOUGH   Spenser scholars had found various references to the 4xiochus, no copy was \n               known  until the discovery of one, now in his possession, was announced in 1932 by \n               Professor F.M.Padelford. The  existence of the present copy was not known until its \n               appearance in 1936 in the auction-room. The recovery of this copy is of singular impor- \n              tance because the Padelford copy, inlaid throughout, lacks the final sheet D containing \n              the  text of the Speech of the Earl of Oxford\u2019s Page (see Plate No.L). Thus for that \n              charming  piece, which from evidence presented below may perhaps be ascribed to John \n               Lyly, the present copy is the sole authority. \n                 In 1934, Professor  Padelford issued a facsimile reprint of the Axiochus portion \n              together with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of such evidence as can be found to substantiate the publisher's \n\n                  taSheets \u20ac{ and D  were printed by John Charlewood,  while sheets A-C appear to be by another printer, \n\n                    possibly Edward Allde. \n                  {8This address is not recorded\u2014 Burby used it the same year in Greene\u2019s Repentance but later he used only \n\n                     the phrase \u2018in the Poultry\u2019. \n                  teMr.L.M.Irby   of Sotheby\u2019s writes that he is \u2018nearly positive\u2019 that this book was removed, together with \n                     Fortrey\u2019s England\u2019s Interest 1663 (Pendarves sale, Lot 87), from a volume of tracts dating from 1652 to \n                     1720 (Pendarves sale, Lot 8). That volume has since been broken up, the binding scrapped and the tracts \n\n                 sold by the purchaser. \n              VOL.III                                   [ 995 ]\n\nattribution of that translation to the poet Spensertd. The case which Padelford makes \n                           out is one which, failing direct testimony, will probably be accepted by Spenser scholars \n                          generally. The only dissension so far has been the suggestion of BernardFreyd(P.M.L.4. \n                            L,pp-903-8) that Anthony Munday   is a more likely candidate. His evidence, however, \n                            is not convincing (see Padelford\u2019s reply, op. cit. pp.908-13). \n                              Now,  while the identity of the translator of the Axiochus has been well canvassed, \n                            the authorship of the appended Speech, since it has never been available for study, has \n                            notte. It is mentioned on the title and is therefore an integral part of the volume, but \n                            it is mentioned without any implication as to the authorship. That it is not mentioned \n                            in the publisher's prefatory matter, nor in the Axiochus entry in the Stationers\u2019 Reg- \n                            ister, and is printed on a separate sheet (D), probably indicates that it was a late addi- \n                            tion decided upon after sheet C was printed off\u2014the last leaf of that sheet, otherwise, \n                            would not normally  have been left blank\u2014and  after the entry in the Stationers\u2019 Reg- \n                            ister for the Axiochus alone had been made, 1 May  15921.  The sheet containing the \n                            Speech and  also the preliminary sheet were printed at the same shop, Charlewood\u2019s. \n                            That  the Speech is mentioned on the title but not in Burby\u2019s preliminary addresses \n                            may  be due  solely to the circumstances that those addresses were already prepared \n                            when  the decision to append the Speech was made and Burby did not consider it neces- \n                            sary to introduce any reference to the Speech. It is also possible that Burby did not \n                            know  who  had written the Speech and it is even more likely that he had not obtained \n                            the manuscript  which he here printed from the author, see below. \n                               \"The tournament at which this \u2018fweet {peech or Oration [was] fpoken\u2019 can be identi- \n                            fied as that held at Whitehall the 22nd January 1581, by the following chain of evidence. \n                             In the Speech itself (see Plate No.L), the Earl of Oxford assumes, for the purpose of \n                             the devicetg, the character of \u201cThe Knight of the Tree of the Sonne\u2019.

According to The Booke \n\n                                    {dit will be observed that the title attributes the work to \u2018Edw. Spenfer\u2019 while Burby\u2019s note \u2018To the Reader\u2019 \n                                      gives the full name \u2018Edward  Spenfer'. The poet\u2019s full name, at the time of this publication, had not \n                                      appeared  on any title. As late as 1623, Dr. Heffner has noted, Camden referred to the poet, whom he \n                                      knew  personally, as \u2018Edward Spenser\u2019. \n                                    fePadelford assumed, and  the Sotheby cataloguers sought to prove, that it was also by Spenser. \n                                    $/The  paper is the sume throughout except in sheet B. \n                                    glt  was at this time customary for the pages of the participants in a tourney to make for their masters some \n                                      speech or verses addressed to the Queen. One of the best descriptions of such an occasion occurs in Lupold \n                                      von  Wedel\u2019s diary of a tour of England  in 1584 (Royal Historical Society Trans. and S.

Whether  Bedingfield or some other, a passage on P-102 indicates that the author \n                         was not Segar: \u201cMy  meaning  was here to haue inferted all the Speaches, Emblemes, deuifes, Pofies, and \n                         other Complements,  vfed in all Challenges & other publique exercifes of Armes fince her maiefties Raigne: \n                         but for want of obferuation, or rather lack of fome fufficient man to haue fet them prefently downe, those \n                         things cannot be recouered.

If Spenser, presuming that he was \n                           the translator, still had a copy of the Axiochus he would probably have turned it over \n                           to Ponsonby,  his publisher, when, in 1590, Ponsonby  was gathering old scraps and \n                           early work  for the Complaints. It is, therefore, likely that Burby found these uncon- \n                           sidered trifles in transcripts which had long passed out of their authors\u2019 hands. He put \n                            them together in one volume  not because they  had any  relation to each other but \n                           merely  to make up a pamphlet  which would  sell for sixpencetr. Whatever his motive \n                           may  have been, and whether or not he found it a profitable venture, in issuing this book \n                            Burby placed modern  scholarship in his debt, for not only did he then publish a work \n                            now generally included in the Spenserian canon but he also added another item to the \n                            short list of Elizabethan court entertainments. \n\n                                   {pPadelford  assigns the translating to \u2018a date well prior to the writing of The Shepheardes Calendar\u2019. \n                                   jgin 1592, Burby\u2019s name  appears as publisher on at least eight other titles besides the present: S.T.C. 22718 \n                                      (Pt,  4 looking glasse for drunkards), 15696, 12283, 13133, 17206, 12306, 22682, and 22697. Of these he \n                                     made   entry only for the first two (28 April and 12 May, Arber I1.610 and  612). In the other cases he \n                                      acquired the rights from Scarlet, Wolfe or Danter, who had already entered the books in the Stationers\u2019 \n                                      Register. These stationers were primarily printers and presumably had made their entries to register their \n                                      copyright in order that they might sell the publishing rights to someone, like Burby, who would agree, as \n                                      he evidently did, to employ them to print the books. Of the books which Burby  published this year the \n                                      only ones to go into a second edition were some of Smith\u2019s sermons and it is possible that Burby was not \n                                      the owner of their copyright for two of them (S.T.C. 22682 and 22697) were not formally transferred to \n                                      him until 6t* September 1596. All of Burby\u2019s 1592 publications were slight pamphlets ranging from three \n                                      to six sheets. \n                                    frie was not until 1598 that the Company regulated the wholesale price of books (see Lidrary 1V,1903,p.364) \n                                      but presumably  they then merely enforced the prevailing rate of a penny for two sheets. \n\n                               ARBER  II. 610.

The Charles Lilburn\u2014 \n               Hagen  (1918, Lot 1174) copy with bookplates. \n\n             THERE  are two states of the outer forme of sheet C, of which the present, according to \n             Johnson, is the earlier. \n               The \u2018Colin Clout\u2019 is a narrative satire on court life written immediately after Spen- \n             ser\u2019s return to Kilcolman in 1591. It is, however, the only one besides the \u201cAstrophel\u2019 of \n             the five pieces included in this volume which was written by Spenser. The others were \n             written by his friends Ludowick Bryskett, Matthew Roydon and  Sir Walter Raleigh. \n             \u201cThe mourning Muse  of Thestylis\u2019 was separately licensed to John Wolfe in 1587, and \n            may  very probably have been printed by him though no copy is known. When entered \n            in the Stationers\u2019 Register it was attributed to Bryskett. The \u2018Pastoral Aeglogue vpon \n            the death of Sir Phillip Sidney Knight\u2019 is signed \u2018L.B.\u2019, which letters are believed to be \n            the initials of Bryskett. W.P.Mustard (4m. Fournal of Philology XXXV, 1914, p.192) \n            has shown  that not only do these two poems show many  similarities in their English \n            form  but they are both very close paraphrases of poems by Tasso. \n               The poem  entitled \u2018An Elegie, or Friends passion for his Astrophill\u2019 is usually attrib- \n            uted  to Matthew   Roydon.  Nashe  is believed to be referring to this poem when he \n            speaks in his preface to Greene\u2019s Menaphon 1589, of Roydon\u2019s \u2018immortall Epitaph of \n            his beloued Astrophel\u2019. Passages are quoted as Roydon\u2019s work in England\u2019s Parnassus \n            1600, and the poem was first printed in The Phoenix Nest 1593. The two epitaphs which \n            follow the \u2018Elegie\u2019 are attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh on the evidence of notes by \n            Harington  and Drummond    which appear to refer to them. \n\n             S.T.C. 23077.

The \n                               matter is somewhat  obscure but  B.E.C.Davis  (M.L.R.  XX,  1925, pp.21-24) has set \n                               forth the evidence as it is contained in contemporary allusion and as it may be con- \n                               jectured from what is known of the later history of the offending pieces. \n                                 Since the \u2018Muiopotmos\u2019  alone is dated 1590, and since, although only 440 lines in \n                               length, it contains more than half of the passages in which different copies of this edition \n                               have variant readings, de Selincourt has suggested \u2018it is possible that the poem was \n                               printed, though not published, separately in that year, so that Spenser had a chance of \n                               seeing it in proof\u2019. Whether Spenser saw it or not, it is extremely unlikely from the \n                               bibliographical evidence that that portion was printed separately from the rest. Some \n                               of the variant readings are: \n\n  \n\n                                               Recto Va, line 18    | Dull...               | Poppie . . . \n                                               Recto V3, line12     \u2014. .. difpacing...      \u2014. . . difplacing . . \u00ab \n                                                Verso V4, line 26   Enfeftred               Enfefted \n\n                                            Recto X, line 12  did flily frame        . . . framde craftilie, | \n                                The present copy has the reading of the second column, but it should be observed that \n                                the Locker-Church-Huntington    has the readings of the same  column   except for the \n\n                                       [ 1000 ]\n\nlast in which it agrees with the first. Therefore, the corrections were made while the \n              sheets were going through the press and corrected and uncorrected sheets were gathered \n              indiscriminately. (For other variant readings see Scholartis Press edition, 1928, edited \n               W.L.Renwick,  p.266). \n                At  least one so-called large-paper copy is known. It was formerly in the library of \n              Bishop  Gott and measured  more than an inch more in height and almost an inch more \n              in width than the present. \n\n                S.T.C. 23078.

The Griswold (private)\u2014Purdy   (1917, Lot 867) copy with Purdy \n               bookplate. \n\n              Iv the present  copy  the Welsh  words  in lines 4 and 5 of p.332 (Book  II, Canto  10, \n              Stanza 24, of modern  editions) are not printed, spaces being left for them to be filled-in \n              by hand. In some  copies these words are printed, in all cases incorrectly}. The date line \n              of the imprint in this copy is widely spaced, the \u20181\u2019 of \u20181590\u2019 being under the \u2018r\u2019 of \u2018for\u2019. \n              In one of the British Museum copies (George III) the printed \u2018e\u2019 has obviously been altered by scraping to \n\n                    look like \u2018c\u2019 and therefore  does not really represent  a third state. \n\n         VOL.II                         [ 1001 ]\n\nApparently  it is the earlier state because if the compressed setting, which like the pres- \n                               ent is off center, were the earlier then the obvious and natural thing for a printer to do \n                               to re-center it would be to move the four digits, not to space them. It seems more likely, \n                               as well as simpler, that the compositor first set the date widely spaced\u2014a style which \n                               would  be difficult to find the like in Elizabethan printing\u2014and, when told to close it \n                               up by  the corrector, merely removed the em  spaces and pushed  the type over to the \n                               right. \n                                  The volume as first issued ended on verso [Pp8] (p.606) with the list of errata. In that \n                               form  it contained only ten complimentary   sonnets (pp.601-5), none  of which  were \n                               addressed to Burghley.  It is well known that this was not an accidental omission on \n                               Spenser's part. The poet\u2019s friends realized the impropriety of the offense and no doubt \n                               urgently appealed to him to rectify his error. Indeed, Israel Gollancz has pointed out \n                               that Nashe  includes such an appeal in his Pierce Pennilesse (McKerrow  Nashe  I, pp. \n                               243-4), where he says \u2018And heere (heauenlie Spenser) I am most highlie to acuse thee of \n                               forgetfulnes, that in that honourable catalogue of our English Heroes, which insueth \n                               the conclusion of thy  famous  Fairie Queene, thou wouldst  let so speciall a piller of \n                                Nobilitie passe vnsaluted. The verie thought of his far deriued  discent, & extraor- \n                               dinarie parts, wherewith he astonied the world, and drawes all harts to his loue, would \n                               haue  inspired thy forewearied Muse with new furie to proceede to the next triumphs of \n                                thy statelie Goddesse: but as I, in fauor of so rare a scholler, suppose, with this counsell \n                               he refraind his mention in this first part, that he might with full saile proceed to his \n                               due  commendations   in the second  . . . \u2019. The poet yielded and produced  a sonnet \n                               which  surely must  have  been sufficiently saccharine and obsequious  to satisfy the \n                                \u2018renowned lord\u2019 of \u2018far deriued discent\u2019. In order that no further attention should be \n                               attracted to the offense it was necessary that the sonnet be inserted in such a way that \n                               due  honor would be given to the Lord High  Treasurer. The problem  was further com- \n                               plicated by the fact that the poet had composed  six other sonnets (whether  from an \n                                excess of remorse or the desire that Burghley should not be singled out for the distinc- \n                                tion cannot be decided) which he desired to have inserted at the same time. \n                                  Instead of merely printing the new sonnets on a sheet to be appended to the volume \n                                as originally printed it was decided to cancel leaves [Pp6 and 7], containing eight of \n                                the ten original sonnets and to reprint these sonnets with the new ones but rearranged, \n                                probably for considerations of precedence and compliment.   The  cancellans occupies \n                                four leaves (sheet signed 9g) which are unnumbered but intended to be inserted between \n                                pp.600 and 605, Sig [Pps] and [Pp8]. Sig [Pp8] was not intended to be cancelled, as is \n                                usually stated, for it contains on the recto two sonnets which were not included in the \n                                cancellans and which, being the only ones  in the original series addressed to ladies, \n                                might very well be retained at the end! The verso of this leaf, moreover, contains the \n                                errata which, naturally, it would be necessary to retain. \n                                  The  confusion which has arisen in regard to these final leaves is due to the fact that \n                                the intended cancellation and substitution were made  in only a very few cases. It is \n                                not unlikely, however, that the present copy at one time had these leaves cancelled and \n\n                                        [ 1002 ]\n\nat a later date was supplied with leaves from a shorter copy for these two leaves are \n               the only ones in the volume which are extended. However, the reprinting of the sonnets \n               was done very shortly after the original printing, as noted above, not only because one \n               of the new sonnets is addressed to Sir Francis Walsingham who died in 1590, and the \n               original setting, with minor corrections was again employed in the cancellans, but also \n               because the great majority of copies (20 out of 25 copies examined) have both states of \n               the sonnets which may  be assumed  to indicate that the reprint was made before very \n               many  copies had  been sold. That the cancellation and substitution was not effected \n               may  be satisfactorily explained by the fact that the signatures of the cancellans would \n               naturally indicate to the binder that those leaves were intended to follow Sig [Pp8], \n               there being no binders\u2019 note to the contrary. It is rather frivolous to expect that a \n               binder would discover for himself that the contents of Sig [Pp6 and 7] are repeated on \n               Sig Qg1 to [4]. However, it is due to this cause rather than to some happy clemency of \n              chance  that so many dealers\u2019 catalogues are able to boast copies of this book with both \n              states of the sonnets. \n                 A copy of this volume in the Harmsworth Library is without the dedication to Eliza- \n              beth on  the verso of the title. That copy is otherwise remarkable for the possession of \n              the inner sheet of quire E  in duplicate in two states. The outer forme of this sheet \n              (pp-67, 70, 71, and 74) is imposed correctly in both states but in one state the inner \n              forme  (pp.68, 69, 72, and 73) was turned about in such a way, when the sheet was per- \n              fected, that p.68 is printed in the position of p.72, and p.72 in that of 68, etc., (see \n              Sawyer  and  Darton  English Books 1, 76-8). \n                 The second edition of this volume, 1596, while uniform with the first edition of the \n              second volume,  and for the most part a paginary reprint of the present, may be easily \n              distinguished from it by the fact that the last five glorious stanzas of the first edition, \n              beginning  (p.588 1.10) \u2018At last she came vnto the place, . . . \u2019, one of them the most \n              rapturous that Spenser ever wrote, are replaced by three stanzas which omit the details \n              of the reunion of faire Amoret and Scudamour.  Moreover, the last page of the second \n              edition is 590, which necessitates the omission of most of the appended matter found \n              in the first edition. However, the 1596 edition contains many minute alterations for \n              which  the author himself was responsible (see J.C.Smith ed. Faerie Queene 1, XVII). \n\n               S.T.C. 23080,  ARBER   II. 536. HunTINGTON   C.L., 401,  CHuReH  Car. II, 987 (tp. facs.). \n               Grouter  CLus  L-W, 200.  Hor  Car.

Having a number of \n                            unsold copies of the 1609 Faerie Queen still on his hands, he determined to use those \n                            copies by including them in the collected edition in lieu of a 1611 reprint of the same. \n                            In order to effect this end he printed the general-title and the dedicatory leaf on a single \n                            sheet, unsigned, and so was enabled thus to make-up   copies of a collected edition by \n                            cancelling the title of the 1609 edition and substituting the new general-title and dedi- \n                            catory leaf and adding a 1611 edition of the remaining parts. \n                              The  1591 edition of Spenser\u2019s Complaints [q.v.] having been officially suppressed on \n                            account of the attack on Lord Burghley contained in the \u2018Mother  Hubberd\u2019s  Tale\u2019 and \n                            in certain passages of the \u2018Ruines of Time\u2019, Lownes  was not free to include the con- \n                            tents of that volume in this collected edition without obtaining official permission. By \n                            1611, the matter had long blown  over and Burghley,  the object of the satire, was now \n                            dead, but in deference to Sir Robert Cecil, his son, it was considered advisable to omit \n                            the offending satire and to revise the objectionable passages in the \u2018Ruines of Time\u2019. \n                            Therefore, some copies, e.g. the present, of the 1611 edition which were sold soon after \n                            publication did not contain the \u2018Mother Hubberd\u2019s  Tale\u2019 but since Cecil died in 1612, \n                            the last objection to the republication of that work was removed   and so copies of it \n                            were separately printed and inserted in those copies which remained on hand, see next \n                            number. \n\n                              S.T.C.  23084.

This reprinted \n               edition may be quickly distinguished by the title of the Second Part (p.187) which is \n              dated  1612 (in some copies, e.g. Huntington 69561 and  the present, the date alone is \n               altered to 1613) while the colophon of that part, p.[364], is dated \u201816012\u2019 [sic]. \n                 As explained in the preceding number, the \u2018Mother Hubberd\u2019s Tale\u2019 was not inserted \n              in copies of the 1611 edition which were sold prior to Sir Robert Cecil\u2019s death in 1612, \n              at which  time  the last obstacle to its republication was removed. After that time, \n              however,  it was inserted in the unsold copies of the 1609-11 issue and all later issues. \n                 There are two editions of this separately printed portion, one of which consists of a \n              single quire, A\u00ae. Of this edition there are two issues which differ only by the date on \n              the title which in one, e.g. the present, is 1612, and, in the other, 1613. The other edition, \n              and  certainly the later (although it is undated), collates: A*, B-C?. This edition bears \n              the imprint: \u2018Printed by H.L.  and are to be sold by G.Lathum.\u2019 and, therefore, must \n              have  been issued after 31st January 1620 when Latham  took up his freedom and very \n              likely after 6th November   1628 (28th June  1628), when Lownes  assigned to George \n              Cole and  Latham  his right in \u2018the fairy Queene\u2019 (Arber IV.205). \n                 Mr. Bernard  E. C. Davis has pointed out (M.L.R. XX, 1925, 18ff.) that asa result of \n              the calling in of the 1591 quarto of the Complaints and the existence of manuscript copies \n              (e.g. the W.H.Crawford-Gollancz    MS., dated sth June  1605, now at the Rosenbach \n              Company)   made  in consequence  of this suppression, there is reason to believe that in \n              those places where  the text of this Folio edition diverges from that of the quarto the \n              folio readings may not only  be superior but may also have more authoritative value. \n                The  result of using the 1609 edition was that the stock of some of the additional \n              matter  in the 1611 edition was exhausted before the stock of the 1612 printing of the \n              Faerie Queen.  In 1617, a new  title-sheet was printed and prefixed to the remainder \n              stock, the additional pieces being reprinted when necessary. (Even now it seems that \n              some  of the original copies of 1609 remained and were issued with the general-title and \n              additional matter dated 1617. A copy in this state which, however, might be \u2018made-up\u2019, \n              is in the Trinity College Cambridge Library). The part containing the Colin Clout etc. \n              is always found reprinted in copies having the 1617 title and, for the most part, so is \n              the Shepheards Calendar which  in the reprinted form has the imprint: \u2018London, Printed \n              by Bar: Alsop for Iohn Harrison the elder, and are to bee solde at his shop at the signe \n\n            VOL.                           [ 1007 ]\n\nof the golden Anker in Pater Noster Row, 1617.\u2019. The reason for this alteration in the \n                           imprint is due to the fact that the rights in this book since the publication of the first \n                           edition, 1579, had belonged to the Harrison family who, no doubt, forced Lownes to \n                           give them compensation  for having appropriated their property in 1611. Copies of the \n                           1617 edition of this poem are sometimes met with separately bound  (S.T.C. 23094, a \n                           copy in that state is now at the Rosenbach Company). \n\n                             S.T.C, 23084.

The  Daphnaida  was \n                           printed separately in 1591, a book which is now the rarestt of all Spenser items except \n                           the Axiochus  1592 [q.v.]. \n                              For a discussion as to the possibility of this title having been privately printed and \n                           originally issued bound with the Prothalamion, see note.

At the time of the Heber sale this volume was still bound in the \n                Roxburghe  red morocco. \n\n               In some  copies (e.g. the Ashley) the catchword on recto B2 reads \u2018To\u2019, but in most, \n               including the present, the catchword has been corrected to \u2018From\u2019. This alteration was \n               effected while the half-sheet was in the press. \n                  Grosart conjectures that the present was privately printed because it was not entered \n               in the Stationers\u2019 Register and there may be considerable weight to that argument if \n               the Fowre hymnes  1596, is included for that also was printed for Ponsonby and without \n               license; these two titles being the only ones, except the 1591 Daphnaida and possibly \n               also Colin Clout 1595, of the eight Spenser titles printed for Ponsonby to be so dis- \n               tinguished. As a corollary to this proposition it should be observed that it is not at all \n               unlikely that some  copies of the present were originally sold by Ponsonby bound up \n               with the Fowre  hymnes. \n                 The  rarity of this book appears to have been exaggerated. There are at least fifteen \n               copies the present location of which is known and four others unlocated. \n\n                  +The  printer may be identified as John Windet from the block used on the title which was originally Wolfe\u2019s \n                     and passed to Windet about  1593. \n\n                S.T.C, 23088.

The first two stanzas of March are lacking, though probably \n                               once supplied. October is entirely lacking except for the first stanza but the two blank leaves \n                               which immediately  follow (35-6) were apparently intended to contain  the four remaining pages \n                               of the translation. The verso fol.35 has a \u20189\u2019 in an old hand at the top outer corner, all that \n                               remains of \u201879\u2019 the number  of that page in the 1597  text. November   lacks the translation of \n                               pp.90-1, and in this case, likewise, a leaf (39) was left blank. \n\n                           Turee  other manuscripts of this translation are known, two are in the British Museum, \n                           and  one is at Pembroke  College, Cambridge.  They  are, like the present, written in \n                           several hands, and all, as was once the present, are interleaved in copies of the Shep- \n                           heards Calendar 1597. The  Pembroke  copyt has a draft of a dedication, in Bathurst's \n                           hand  to Dr.Harsnet, master of the college from 1605 to 1616. As Bathurst received his \n                           fellowship at Pembroke in 1608, and belonged to the anti-Harsnet faction in the college \n                           during the latter half of Harsnet\u2019s mastership it is probable that the translation was \n                           made  about  1608. \n                              It has not been possible to compare the four MSS. but the similarity of their format \n                           would  appear to indicate coeval manufacture. Whether   or not that may  be granted, \n                           there seems to be no plausible reason why  at least four such copies should exist for, \n\n                                {See paper by Prof.Leicester Bradner Mod.

It was, however, insertedtf in the margin in \n             the same  hand as the rest of that Ecgloga. \n               The  improvements   in the text which may be found in the edition of 1653, and again \n             as reprinted in 1732, are probably due to Dr. William Dillingham, the editor, who had \n             a reputation as a Latin versifier. \n\n                 #The present appears  to have been  copied from another MS,  because in the third line of the November \n                   Ecgloga the scribe has written \u2018menfa\u2019 for \u2018mufa\u2019, a natural error of transcription, although in the very \n                   next line he has \u2018Mufa\u2019 correctly transcribed. \n                HThis   stanza was also omitted in the 1611  folio edition of the Works and the English version was only \n                  inserted in the errata of Dillingham\u2019s edition of this translation, 1653 [q.v.] with a note protesting \u2018Be \n                  Pleased to take notice that in the later Edition of Spencers Poems in Folio (which should have been the \n                  best) there is wanting one whole Stanza in the month of June, which out of the first Edition of the Shep- \n                  herds calendar in Quarto may  be thus supplied, and is to come in after page 70, |. 10 of this Book . . . \n                  In the 1679 folio edition of the works it was once again omitted and was not apparently missed until the \n                  1653 edition was consulted for the Bathurst Latin version when a similar note to that of Dillingham's was \n                  appended.",

Harvey, in his \n                Foure Letters, and certaine Sonnets 1592, refers to this book as follows: \u2018It was the \n                sinister hap of these unfortunate letters to fall into the hands of malicious enemies or \n                indiscreet friends, who ventured to imprint in earnest what was scribbled in jest\u2019. \n                  Sir Sidney Lee  declared that there is a unique copy of the \u2018Two other, very com- \n                mendable  letters\u2019 in the British Museum but that is an error arising probably from a \n                misreading of the B.M.Catalogue  and, for some  reason, perpetuated in McKerrow\u2019s \n                Devices, p.34. \n                  On  verso E2 occurs a poem entitled \u2018Speculum Tuscanismi\u2019 in ridicule of an Italian- \n                ate Englishman  which, whether it was so intended or not, might be read as an attack \n                upon  the Earl of Oxford  (see McKerrow   Nashe  IV, pp.176-7). Since the Earl had \n                quarrelled with Spenser\u2019s great friend Sir Philip Sidney in 1579, it does not seem \n                unreasonable that the intent of the poem should have been so construed. At any rate \n                the author of Pappe with a Hatchet (Lyly) apparently had already for some unknown \n                reason harbored  ill-will against Harvey and brought the poem to Oxford\u2019s attention \n                with the hope of incensing him against its author. The Earl, however, appears to have \n                taken little notice of the matter and it would at this time hardly warrant recording if it \n                were not to this affair that the original offence and the subsequent alignment of the \n                Harvey  and anti-Harvey  groups in the Harvey-Nashe  quarrel may be traced. \n                  Only  five other copies are known, viz. the British Museum,   Bodleian (Pearson- \n                Malone),  Huntington  (Huth, imperfect), F.B.Bemis (Bright-Lefferts- White), and the \n                imperfect White copy  now at the Rosenbach  Company. \n\n                 S.T.C. 23095.

The ascription to Spenser is \n              probably based  upon the evidence of the title-page although in the dedication Walkley \n              admits  that he has no definite proof that Spenser wrote the poem, but he was \u2018cer- \n              tainely assured by the ablest, and most knowing men, that it must be Worke of Spen- \n              cers\u2019. In 1762, Thomas  Warton  disputed Walkley\u2019s ascription and declared that the \n              manner  of the poem  was like that of Fletcher\u2019s Purple Island. Grosart attempted in \n              1869, to produce evidence of style in support of this theory and was seconded by Boas. \n              However,  the question may   be considered definitely settled by the discoveryt of a \n              Sion College MS.  of this poem under what was probably  the author\u2019s title, \u2018Venus & \n              Anchises\u2019. The MS.  contains additional lines not included when printed which ascribe \n              the authorship of this poem to \u2018Thyrsil\u2019, Phineas Fletcher's poetic pseudonym. \n                Including these two copies only seven can be traced, viz. the Bodleian, Huntington \n              (Farmer-Locker-Church),   John Rylands,  Chapin  (Huth), and another  belonging to \n              Mr. Loveday,  Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bristol. \n\n                 tThis discovery was first announced by Miss Seaton in the 7.L.8. 22 March 1923, and commented  upon by \n                    Dr.Boas the following week.

No. 982\n\n\n\n+ This order is supported by the reading of the title of the Cologne edition which is \u2018erstlich in Brabandisch \n                     beschrieben\u2019. The Dutch  and French editions, though from the evidence of ornaments and initials printed \n                     by different printers, have etched illustrations [by Collaerts?] from the same plates which therefore pre- \n                     sumably  belonged to the author. Particularly is this likely because the German edition \u2018Theatrum das ist \n                     Schawplatz  . . . \u2019 which the B.M.Catalogue ascribes \u2018[Cologne ? 1572)\u2019 has the same woodcut illustrations \n                     as the English edition, although it was certainly printed in Germany, which circumstance  seems best \n                     explained by \u201cie suggestion of Mr.F.S.Ferguson  that the blocks were owned by Van der Noot  and that \n                     he took then. to Germany  with him. See the transcription of this title in the Hoe Cat, For. Lang., II, 195. \n                       Hazlitt mentions a \u2018Flemish\u2019 edition \u2018Antwerp, 1572\u2019 of which no trace can be found.       ; \n                   Spenser  must  have been a precocious youth if he was the Spenser to whom Turberville addressed his letter \n                     written from Russia  1569, published in his Tragical Tales 1587. \n\n  \n\n                S.T.C, 18602.

Moreover, most \n                            copies have been rebound and  since the problems involved are mainly concerned with \n                            the order of issue and not of printing they are not impeccable evidence. \n                               Contrary to the accepted view, Johnson has suggested, that Spenser\u2019s View of the \n                            state of Ireland was the first part printed and that the later state of the title usually \n                            found in it which, though otherwise from the same setting as the earlier, has substituted \n                            for an ornament a  sentence stating \u2018Whereunto  is added the History  of Ireland by \n                            Edmund   Campion   . . . \u2019 indicates that Ware decided to issue the two works together \n                            before he contemplated publishing the Hanmer Chronicle. Unfortunately no copies have \n                            survived of those two parts alone. \n                               The  Campion-Hanmer   section was originally supplied with a title reading: \u2018Two \n                            histories of Ireland.

The \n                              rest of the title is from the same setting in both states, the alteration having been made \n                              while the sheet was in the press. One can only conjecture regarding the relative order \n                              of these variants but this much is relevant, in the author's address Stephens makes the \n                              assertion: \u2018 . . . And with all so vn-willing am I to play Tom-foole in Print for name- \n                              sake, as I haue purposly  concealed it from the Impression,  so as the petty volume \n                              enioyes his fortune Fatherlesse: for indeed (if publishing what was intended priuate \n                              were not so common)   this had  been free for my selfe and familliars alone, notwith- \n                              standing the publicke stampe; onely to auoide the false imputed taxe of idle and haire- \n                              brained disability; not fearing what plume any  garrulous fowle of the aire can chal- \n                              lenge, . . . \u2019, which appears to indicate that it was his intention that the work should \n                              be issued anonymously.  The  verses signed \u2018B[en]. Ifonson?].\u2019 lend support to this con- \n                              ception. However,  the fact that some copies, including the present, have the author's \n                              name  on the title may be variously explained as a printer\u2019s carelessness or blunder in \n                              carrying out  instructions which was  later corrected or else that such  copies were \n                              intended for presentation to the author's \u2018familliars\u2019. \n                                 Kirkman,  followed by Halliwell and Hazlitt, assigned this play to a John Swallow \n                              upon  a misreading  of the distich by  F[rancis]. C[rane?]. which probably  was only \n                              intended to convey the idea that this first production of the author's pen ranked him a \n                              full-fledged poet. Stephens claims this work as his own in a note introduced into the \n                              second edition of his Essayes 1615, p.136 [q.v.], as was pointed out by Percy Simpson \n                              M.L.R.

This reissue was probably occa- \n                            sioned by the publication, in 1630, of the \u2018Secunda editio auctior\u2019 of Ruggle\u2019s guoramus. \n                              The promises of the title regarding addicions and emendations are fulfilled with a \n                            fidelity somewhat uncommon  in books of this period. Stephens, it would seem, was 4 \n                            particularly self-conscious writer (see Cinthia\u2019s Revenge), and when the character of \n                            \u201cA common  Player\u2019 (1st edition, Book II ch. IV), which apparently was not written by \n\n                                                      [ 1026 ]\n\nhimselff, was rather scurrilously attacked by an anonymous   supplementor  who  is \n              believed to be John Webster, see N. &  Q. 1913-1915 and Murphy   p.1o, in the \u2018sixt\u2019 \n              edition of Sir T.Overburie his Wife 1615, he was very much exercised and immediately \n              brought forth the present edition with appropriate comments regarding his unknown \n              detractor, albeit with the character in question somewhat enfeebled by a lame con- \n              clusion tacked on as an answer to the strictures. However, his haste in bringing out \n              this second edition was not so great that he did not find time to revise, supplement and \n              alter the whole work; as he says in the dedication \u2018Diligence and better knowledge, \n              haue made  it a much better volumne\u2019t. \n                \u2018The most important addition which was made in this edition is the \u2018Essay the fourth \n              entituled Reproofe. Or a defence  for common  Law  &  Lawyers  mixt with reproofe \n              against the Lawyers common    Enemy\u2019. It is a poetical reply to Ruggle\u2019s Ignoramus, \n              acted twice before King James earlier in this same year, much to the irritation of the \n              lawyers, see edition by J.S.Hawkins, 1787. Indeed, so general was the protest of the \n              legal community  that the desire to publish this satire may have been as powerful a \n              motive in causing the author, who was  a member  of Lincoln\u2019s Inn, to republish this \n              book so shortly after the first edition as the cause above mentioned. \n                We  have not been able to learn why Sig [D7-8] were cancelled. They are replaced in \n              both of the other copies of the dozen or more known which we have examined. However, \n              in the present enough of the stub of [D7] remains so that the last letter\u2014s\u2014of the \n              catchword  on verso is preserved. In the cancellans that catchword is \u2018Leaft\u2019. The \n              alteration appears to have been a substitution rather than an addition for the cancel- \n              Jans has twenty-eight lines to the page as in the rest of the Essay. \n\n                  tin the address prefixed to the present edition Stephens referring to this character says periphrastically that \n                    he did \u2018admit  a friends Satyre\u2019. It seems not unlikely that this \u2018friend\u2019 was none other than the I.Cocke \n                    who  wrote and signed  the diatribe included in this volume. Chambers (Elizabethan Stage LV, 255) suggests \n                    the possibility that \u2018Cocke\u2019 was the John Cooke who  wrote Greene's Tu Quogue. At any rate, Cocke claims \n                    as his the characters  of the Tinker, the Apparatour   and the Almanack-maker    which appeared  in the \n                    \u2018sixt\u2019 edition of Sir T.Overburie 1615. \n                  As  an interesting example of the care with which this edition was edited it may be observed that the addition \n                    of the character of \u2018A sicke Machiavell Pollititian\u2019, one of the seven characters which first appeared in this \n                    edition, caused the author  to alter the simile with which he began the character of \u2018A Parish Polititian\u2019 \n                    in the first edition, apparently from purely artistic reasons. \n\n               S.T.C. 23250.

It is written in the style and with the viewpoint \n                               of the Mirror for Magistrates and, doubtless, in imitation of that compilation. \n                                 It has been frequently asserted that Shakespeare must have been familiar with this \n                               work when writing Henry VIII for the passage in the later work where Wolsey exclaims \n                               \u2018Had I but served my God  with half the zeal I served my king, He would not in mine \n                               age Have left me naked to mine enemies.\u2019 seems to echo that in which Storer says: \n                                                  And  had the dutie to my God bin such, \n                                                  As it was faithful serving to the King, \n                                                  Then had my conscience free from feare or touch, \n                                                   Mounted aloft on Cherubins swift wing, \n                                                  In holy consort borne a Part to sing. \n                               However, the resemblance of these passages is misleading for they are both based upon \n                               earlier sources, the play on Holinshed and Foxe, the poem probably on Holinshed, and \n\n                                                         [ 1028  ]\n\nthese direct sources appear to have a common   origin in George Cavendish\u2019s Life of \n              Cardinal  Wolsey where  the dying prelate is reported as saying: \u2018Well, well, Master \n               Kingston, I see the matter against me how it is framed; but if I had served God as \n              diligently as I have done the king, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs.\u2019, \n              see 1827 edition, p.387. \n\n               S.T.C. 23294, ARBER IIT, 147.

That edition is an 8 vo., of which there are \n              two  issues. The following year  he issued his Summarie  \u2018abridged\u2019, in 16 mo.  That \n              abridgement  is the direct ancestor of the present. In it the table, address to the reader, \n              dedication, etc. are omitted and the chronicle somewhat  abbreviated. In 1580ff, the \n\n                  {Editions were issued in 1566, 1567, 1573, 1579, 1584, 1587, and 1598. Those of 1579 (copy in Huntington) \n                    and 1584  (Herbert II p.853) are not recorded in the Short-Title Catalogue. \n                  The  original MS. is in the Douce  Collection, MS. 225. \n                  HApparently,  from  a reference in the dedication, the 4 to. edition was first published in 1570, No copy of \n                    such an edition can be traced. \n\n         VOL.                         [ 1029 ]\n\n8 vo. Summarie  was expanded  to 4 to. and, though the plan remained  the same  as in \n                             the smaller size, the address etc. being retained, the chronicle was considerably expanded \n                             and the volume  then entitled The chronicles of England. In 1592, when that 4 to. text \n                             was reprinted, the title was altered to The annales of England under which designation \n                             in later editions the 4 to. text grew to enormous proportions,  finally filling several \n                             volumes folio. The various sizes, 16 mo., 8 vo., and 4 to., were regarded by the pub- \n                             lishers as distinct works and were so entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register (Arber I1.438 \n                             and 600) though large sections of their text are identical. The several editions of each \n                             size are mere reprints\u00a7 with few alterations other than those necessary additions to the \n                             chronicle of events since the preceding issue. \n                               The \u2018abridged\u2019 Summarie  in 16 mo. Ralph  Newbery  and  Henry  Denham   yielded for \n                             the use of the poor of the Company,   8 January  1584fa,  with the provision  that it \n                             should be \u2018printed and sett forthe in the lyke breefe order and forme, that the saide \n                             booke in Decimo  sexto allreadie extant [is] of\u2019 and that all controversies concerning \n                             additions, alterations, etc., should be settled by the Court of Wardens (Arber I1.788). \n                             It was under this arrangement that Richard  Bradock  printed his edition of 1598, and \n                             Harrison the presentta (Arber III.212). \n                               The  minutes of the  Court of the  Stationers\u2019 Company,   5 July  1602, (Greg and \n                             Boswell Records pp.Ixxi and 90) read: \u2018Yt is ordered that m* Stowe shall haue . . . xx$ \n                             & .L. copies for his paynes in the brief cronicle\u2019, which probably refers to the continua- \n                             tion prepared for this edition, the last edition to be edited by the author. \n\n                                  \u00a7The  8 vo. edition of 1590 is in several respects anomalous as the preliminary matter resembles that of a \n                                     16 mo. rather than an 8 vo. The cause of this alteration is perhaps to be found in the death of the Earl of \n                                     Leicester, 1588, the dedicatee of the preceding 8 vo. editions. \n                                  taThe  go December  1584 (Arber  11.438), Newbery and Denham   entered\u2018  . . .

In order to insert the errata on verso \n              [Hhio], the outer sheet of quire Hh (Sig Hh1-2, 9-10) was cancelled and the text reset \n              with the errata added; in this present second issue \u2018FINIS\u2019 is omitted and a diamond- \n              shaped lace-ornament  substituted. A third issue is known, in which Sig [Hhto] is as in \n              the second, but the date on the title is altered to 1599. \n                The size of this original edition must appear ridiculously small to anyone accustomed \n              to the two folio volumes of the eighteenth century editions. However, this present \n              contains much  matter  of great interest and value and is worthy to rank with  the \n              topographical works  of Lambard  and  Carew  as one of the foundations of  English \n             county  history.                                        . \n                At least two copies are known in special presentation calf bindings with the arms of \n             the  City of London  impressed  in gilt on the sides. One copy, the Grenville in the \n              British Museum,  was given by Stowe to his wife, Elizabeth. It has her initials stamped \n             on sides and her name in full in a border of type-ornament printed on verso of title. The \n             other copy,  the Frederick Perkins-White now  at the Rosenbach  Company,  has  \u2018EX \n              DONO   AUTHORIS\u2019     stamped  on front cover but no name of recipient. \n\n                 +The gap  in the pagination at this point may indicate that a different ending was originally intended, prob- \n                   ably without  the Apologie (pp.467-480, 465-472) or part of it, but no copy with Gg uncancelled has been \n                   traced. \n\n              S.T.C, 23341.

For his \u2018paynes\u2019 therein he \n                             was paid three pounds and forty copies by the Stationers\u2019 Company  (see Greg Court \n                             Records p.go). From the fact that the copyright in this book remained in private hands \n                             long after the date of this edition, it would appear that Windet merely acted, in his \n                             capacity as Printer to the City of London, as printer, and that the publisher of this \n                             edition was the Stationers\u2019 Company, perhaps under some arrangement with the widow \n                             of John Wolfe. \n\n                                      fit belonged successively to Wolfe, Pindley, and Purslowe  (see Arber III.121, 483, $35, and Eyre II p.125) \n                                        until at least 1657. \n\n                              S.T.C. 23343.

The Hagen (1918, \n              Lot  1203) copy with bookplate. \n\n             Ar the time this was printed Walkley still retained his rights in Aglaurat which he had \n             published separately in 1638, and he apparently participated in the publication of this \n             collection as his name is given in the imprint to that part. This is particularly inter- \n             esting because the  printer of the Aglaura  portion, though he cannot  be identified \n             since there are no distinctive ornaments, appears not to have been the printer of any \n             other part. The preliminaries, the Godlins, and Brennoralt were printed, by Susan Islip \n             while the Poems and Letters were, as stated in their imprints, the work of Ruth Raworth. \n             Possibly therefore, the arrangement  may  have been  that Walkley was to supply the \n             Aglaura in return for a certain number of complete copies of the book. This appears \n             to be substantiated by differences in the paper. \n               The  rights to Brennoralt  Moseley  acquired by  transfer, 1st August  1646, from \n             Francis Egglesfield and Henry  Twiford. It had been published separately by  Eggles- \n             field, without date but probably about 1640, as The discontented colonell. \n               Regarding  the variant setting of the first line of the general-title see next number. \n\n               They  were not acquired by Moseley until 2and February 1648. \n\n                                                                     Hok Car.

The alterations were apparently made by the trans- \n                         lator in an effort to improve the first stanza of the poem.

In the second \n                         state a cancel slip, pasted over the first stanza, contains an altered version the first line \n                        of  which reads: \u2018I sing the warre made in the Holy land\u2019. In the third, Sig B is cancelled, \n                          \u2014the substituted leaf contains besides an altered \u2018Argument\u2019 a third form of the first \n                         stanza of which  the first line reads: \u2018I sing the sacred armies and the knight\u2019. \n                            In the second edition, 1624, though known  in large-paper condition and apparently \n                         printed  with the knowledge  of the author, the text of the first stanza preserves the \n                         original version.

Sheets B-O were by Elizabeth Allde; A and Aa-Ss, Aaa-Kkk \n                           by Beale, and Aaa~Mmm   by Alsop and Fawcett. The printing of this book was probably \n                           several times interrupted for Boler did not acquire the copyright to most of the pieces \n                           here printed but only, apparently, permission to include them in this collection. \n                             Not all the pieces here included have survived in earlier separate form. Neither are \n                           all of Taylor\u2019s works issued prior to the date of this collection contained in it. The \n                           selection is, nevertheless, a comprehensive one and copies in sound, clean condition \n                           like the present, though not unobtainable, are uncommon. \n                             One of the commendatory   verses is by Thomas Dekker and  in \u2018The Praise of Hemp \n                           Seed\u2019, p.72, is a reference to Shakespeare and to Spenser. \n                             It is possible, at any rate there appears to be some evidence to support such a belief, \n                           that, about 1622, Henry  Gosson issued a collected volume of some half-dozen of the \n                           original octavo editions of Taylor\u2019s works. \n\n                                {It is possible that he may have considered the partners, Alsop and Fawcett, as two printers or even the \n                                   two compositors between whom  the copy printed in Beale\u2019s shop was divided, for it is probable that they \n                                   worked concurrently. \n\n                          S.T.C. 23725.

The purity of \n               Terence\u2019s Latinity was the reason that from Roman  times even to this day his works \n               have been the favorite source of text-book writers for phrases and illustrative examples \n               of Latin construction, as witness the Vulgaria guedam abs Terencio in Anglicam linguam \n               traducta which was several times printed in the fifteenth century as well as most any of \n               the more eclectic Vulgaria. \n                 The  altered quotation from Terence, \u2018Redime  te captum quam  queas minimo\u2019, of \n               The  Taming of the Shrew (1, i, 1.167) is probably not derived from Udall\u2019s book where \n               the verb appears in the volitive form, as in the original, but from Lily\u2019s Latin Grammar. \n                 The  only other copy of this editiont which has been traced is that at Harvard which \n               was formerly the White  copy and may  have been the Britwell duplicate sold at Sothe- \n               by\u2019s in 1910. Four copies of the first edition can be located, the British Museum (Huth), \n\n                    Bodleian,   Harmsworth,      and  Huntington. \n                   tA  third edition, not recorded in the Short-Title Catalogue, was published by Berthelet in 1544. A copy is in \n                     the Folger Library and two others, one the Caldecott- Britwell, are in the possession of London booksellers. \n                     A  unique copy of a fifth edition, T.Marshe 1568, also unrecorded, is in the Folger Library. \n\n                                               W.A.WarTe  Can, 154. \n\n                 S.T.C. 23900.

Copies of both are rare in good condition but it seems probable, from \n                          the evidence of some half-dozen copies, that a complete example of the present state \n                          should have Francis Kirkman\u2019s  first (1661) catalogue, A-B* (see Greg Masques App. \n                          II pp.xliii-cxx). The Huth copy which is an example of the other state has another \n                          catalogue, in three leaves, headed: \u2018An exact and perfect Catalogue  ...\u2019.

In any case there is no reason \n                          to doubt an early edition, though no copy is known because the play is listed in Archer\u2019s \n                          catalogue, 1656. \n                            The  text of this edition has been shown to be a seventeenth century revision, at \n                          least as regards its orthography, of a play which according to its vocabulary appears \n                          to have been written about the middle of the sixteenth century. \n\n                                fIF Kirkman is correct in dating the edition from which he presumably printed \u2018about a hundred Years ago\u2019 \n                                  it would seem that Colwell\u2019s entry had some connection, direct or indirect, with that first edition.

V, 1924, p.118}). He obtained a license for it 27th November 1587, \n              and his name  appears on the title of several other of Ubaldini\u2019s books published about \n              this time. \n                 This work, which  is well printed in a fine italic type, is a free translation of Hector \n               Boece\u2019s Chronicle of which a transcript made by Ubaldini in 1550, dedicated to Lord \n               Arundel in 1576, is in the British Museum (Royal  MS. 13A.viii). The manuscript of \n               this work is in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford (Codec. ccxlvi). A reprint \n               was published at Edinburgh, in 1829, by the Bannatyne  Club. \n                 Only six other copies have been located, viz. the British Museum (Grenville; Royal \n              Library), National Library of Scotland, St. Andrews University, Forster Collection at \n              South  Kensington, and  the F.S.Ferguson, although at least five copies have appeared \n               n auction sales of the last forty years. \n\n                  {lt should be observed, however,  that castings of the ornaments upon which  this identification depends \n                    were used by  other printers besides Wolfe, e.g. the cut or casting on p.s4 is found in books printed by \n                    Vautrollier, Waldegrave, Field, Windet, Orwin and Bradock  as well as Wolfe; while cuttings or castings \n                   of the archer headpiece are found in books printed by Windet, Field, Barker and Lownes. \n\n             S.T.C. 24480.

In this copy \n                          there are manuscript corrections in a neat Italian hand which  may  well be that of \n                          Ubaldini himself, for example, where the outer part of the marginal note on recto D \n                          was cut off by the frisket, the text is restored (in a hand so neat that were it not for \n                          the changed color of the ink it would pass unnoticed); and, verso [D4], the age at the \n                          time of her death of Hester Puckering, wife of Sir Edward Wotton, is inserted in spaces \n                          provided by the printer. \n                            It is possible, though from internal evidence it cannot be substantiated, that this \n                          volume was printed as a New Year's gift to the Queen. At any rate very few copies have \n                          survived; the only other one which can be traced is that in the British Museum. \n\n                                  tn  the same line, in this copy, a misspelling \u2018giomi\u2019 for \u2018giorni\u2019 is corrected by means of a small printed slip \n                                    reading \u2018rni\u2019 which is pasted over the two letters misprinted.

According  to his computation, the earliest edition is that dated both in \n              title and colophon  16 April 1546 (S.T.C.24656). There is a reissuet of that edition in \n              which  the first two sheets are from a distinct setting and the title is dated 25 January \n               1546, i.e.1547 (S.T.C.24655). The  second edition, a separate setting throughout, is \n              dated  in both title and colophon, 25 January (S.T.C.24654). The third edition is that \n              dated  1551. It is the last of Grafton\u2019s editions. The present was probably printed about \n               1560, as that was the period of Tisdale\u2019s activity. \n                 Vergil\u2019s De inventoribus rerum is a most interesting work as may  be gaged by  the \n              fact that  it has been  reprinted more  than a  hundred  times, placed on  the index, \n              expurgated,  and translated into at least five languages. Langley\u2019s English translation \n              unfortunately  reduces the text to about one-third the original so that it is little more \n               than a list of names and facts with Vergil\u2019s commentary  omitted.

The  illustrations \n                           were copied from those Caxton  found in the manuscript  original. The fact that in \n                           nearly all copies the explanations of the cuts are written-in, apparently by the same \n                           hand, see Plate No.LII, has lead to the unsubstantiated belief that that hand was \n                           Caxton\u2019s. It is more likely to have been that of one of his assistants. \n                             Caxton did not produce  this book as his own speculation for, as he states in the \n                          prologue, Sir Hugh Bryce had offered to defray the cost as he wished to present a copy \n                           to William, Lord Hastings, Lieutenant of Calais. \n                             The myrrour of the worlde was translated by Caxton, with sundry amendments, from \n                           the Ymage du monde probably  by \u2018Gossouin of Bruges\u2019 who had translated it from an \n                          obscure Latin original\u2014 Speculum vel imago mundi\u2014which   is usually attributed, but \n                          without real proof, to Vincent de Beauvais, a writer of the reign of St. Louis. A number \n                          of manuscripts of the Ymage du monde  are in existence\u2014Caxton\u2019s text appears to be \n                          closer to one in the Bibliotheque Nationale than to any other known manuscript. \n                             Seventeen other copies can be located, of which, except for the blank leaf, ten are \n                          perfect.

The present is confused by de Ricci with \n                          the Bennett-Morgan  copy, No.13, which was apparently R.Triphook\u2019s, cf. No.26. No.7 \n                          was, according to Oldys, T. Sclater Bacon\u2019s. \n\n                                 Hohn  Holmes,  one of the former owners of this copy, was of the opinion that this was actually Caxton\u2019s \n                                   hand, as was first suggested by Oldys. Holmes published in the Gentleman's Magazine (September 1820, \n                                   p.216) an attempt to prove his contention. \n\n                            S.T.C. 24762.

Sir George Rose (1744- \n              1818), the statesman.  It was  catalogued for sale (Library of Hugh  Campbell   Hume,  3rd \n              Earl of Marchmont,  12 May  1830, Lot 1323) but the sale did not take place and the books were \n              returned to Marchmont\u2019s  grandson, Hugh  Scott of Harden, later Lord Polwarth. This book was \n              sold by his successor (Sotheby's 15 February 1909, Lot 64), and again at the Van Antwerp sale \n              (1922, Lot 5). With bookplate of George  Rosef (\u2018M\u2019 crowned  with earl\u2019s coronet in acknow- \n              ledgment of the bequest by Marchmont of the Cuffnells Library). On verso L3 is an early signature \n              \u2018John Bryges\u2019, possibly that of the first Baron Chandos. \n\n             In the prologue to this work Caxton seems  to reveal himself more completely than in \n             any other of his writings. There he discourses concerning the book itself, of the changes \n             recently introduced into the English language and how different it is from \u2018euydences \n             wryton in olde englysshe . . . more lyke to dutche than englysshe\u2019 which were shown to \n             him by John  Islip, Abbot of Westminster. He shows how deep his interest is in all these \n             matters and  how concerned  he is that this translation shall be as correct as possible. \n             To  this end Caxton  obtained  the aid of Skelton \u2018to ouersee and  correcte... And \n             taddresse and expowne  where  as shalle be founde faulte to theym that shall requyre \n             it\u2019. And in the prologue he tells at some length Skelton\u2019s qualifications for such duties \n             in a passage of considerable importance to the biographers of the poet laureate. \n               This translation is rather far removed from Virgil. Gawin Douglas said that it was \n             no more like Virgil \u2018than the devil is like St. Austin\u2019. It is from a loose French version \n             by Guillaume  le Roy of an Italian paraphrase of portions of the Aeneid, and is, in fact, \n             a kind of eclectic romance based partly on Virgil and partly on Boccaccio\u2019s De casibus \n             virorum. \n               Twenty  other copies can be traced of which, except for the blanks, nine are perfect. \n             Two  of the latter are at Ham  House, two  in the British Museum,  and one each  at \n             University Library Cambridge,  Bodleian (De  Ricci 96.6), Trinity College Cambridge, \n             Rylands, and  Morgan. \n\n                For  supplementary  notes see Bodleian Quarterly I p.266. \n\n              S.T.C. 24796.

This leaf (possibly printed as Sig [bb8]) is usually termed by the booksellers \n                           \u2018rare\u2019 although not only is it almost always present, we have noted over twenty-five \n                           copies which have it, but it is much more common than is the leaf, Sig [bb7], containing \n                           \u201cAne exclamacion aganis detractouris\u2019 and the anagram on the translator\u2019s name. \n                             Though  anonymously   printed this book is ascribed to Copland\u2019s press with little \n                           hesitation as it was obviously intended to be issued with his edition of Douglas\u2019s Palis \n                           of Honoure (one of the University Library Cambridge copies is still so bound). The two \n                           books are uniformly printed and were apparently intended to be bound  together, the \n                           Palis following the Virgil, for while the present has no colophon the other has, and, \n                           though  the present is dated on the title, the other is nowhere dated, so that only \n                           together do they contain all the essential informationf. \n                             It is difficult to understand why this Copland book should be so much more  com- \n\n                                 tCol-F.S.Isaac in his note on the types of John Scot suggests that the text of this book was perhaps printed \n                                    by Scot in Edinburgh, while the title-leaf was printed by Copland. The evidence upon  which he bases \n                                    this is an initial block formerly belonging to Peter Treveris and which he suggests may have come to \n                                    Scot's hands through Thomas Davidson. However,  that block may be found in several books undoubtedly \n                                    printed by Copland both before and after the date of printing of this book. Cf, also Isaac Eng. Printers\u2019 \n                                    Types p.27. His argument, however, ignores the evidence of the \u2018Protestant\u2019 text, see below. \n\n                                                    [ 1066 ]\n\nmon  than any other of his printing, we have located thirty-odd copies and have records \n            of more.  Some  copies, e.g. the Grenville and the Bemis (Hardwicke-Brooke-Kern), \n            measure  slightly more than  834 inches in height although on paper with  the same \n            watermarks  found  in copies of more normal dimension. \n               Because some  of the variant readings of this printed text reflect Copland\u2019s known \n            characteristics of mind and belief with regard to the practice and dogma of what was \n            then called \u2018Papistry\u2019 this edition has been fitly called \u2018The Protestant Edition\u2019. \n               This is the earliest translation of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid into English (really Scots), for \n            Caxton\u2019s  translation [q.v.] has little to do with Virgil. Douglas has included the \n            \u201cThirteenth Book\u2019  of Maphaeus  Vegius. \n\n             $.7.C. 24797.  Huntincton   C.L., 119.  Grower  Crus  L-W,  61.

Laid in \n                 are letters from John P.

Newcombe  entered his copyright in this book the 29th May 1655. \n               On the 31st of the same month Thomason  bought a copy of Lowndes\u2019s edition. As \n\n          VOLT                     [ 1071 ]\n\nThomason  usually purchased a copy  of the earliest edition available, and, further, as \n                              Thorn-Drury,  who  possessed copies of both editions, has shown that the text of the \n                              Lowndes  edition appears to be that of a piratical issue, until conclusive evidence is \n                              forthcoming, the present edition must be considered the later. However, it is so much \n                              the rarer that to the collector it is not less covetable. The British Museum did not \n                              acquire a copy until 1927. \n                                This has been styled \u2018one of the most graceful pieces of adulation ever offered by \n                              poetry to power\u2019. When later Waller wrote a panegyric to Charles  II, the latter com- \n                              plained that he thought it inferior to Cromwell\u2019s. \u2018Sire,\u2019 was the reply, \u2018we poets never \n                              succeed so well in writing truth as in fiction\u2019. \n\n                               Eyre  I, 484.

The first edition was \n               originally published by Thomas   Walkley;  it was reissued by Humphrey   Moseley  in \n               the same  year with a new  title and preliminary matter as well as an additional half- \n               sheet of poems.  That edition has appended  the Three  Speeches which are omitted in \n               the present second edition but were restored in the third edition, published by Moseley. \n               The  third, usually called \u2018the first authorized edition\u2019, purports to be\u2018... Printed by \n               a Copy  of his [Waller\u2019s] own hand-writing\u2019. Whether that was an authorized edition or \n               not can only be conjectured for, while it certainly presents a better text than the other \n               editions of 164st, the edition of 1664 (q.v.] states on the title: \u2018Never till now Corrected \n               and  Published with the approbation  of the Author.\u2019 \n                  The initials of the printer of this edition, T.W., also appear in the imprint of the \n               second  issue title of the first edition. They may belong either to Thomas Warren or \n               to Thomas   Wilson  (the Huth  Catalogue suggests Thomas  Walkley  but he was  not a \n               printer). The third edition was printed by I[ohn].

Since \n                           Moseley had  entered for his copy  in Waller\u2019s poems  14th  December   1644, when \n                           Herringman  proposed to publish the present edition it was necessary for him to obtain \n                           the copyright from Moseley\u2019s widow and register its transfer. \n                             Of the numerous later editions of Waller\u2019s Poems there are two which are of impor- \n                           tance, viz. the illustrated octavo edition of 1711 which contains the earliest life of the \n                          poet, and Fenton\u2019s first edited quarto edition of 1729.

With some other Pieces \n                1690, this volume is condemned as an imperfect and unauthorized edition. \u2018The Copy \n                from which they were printed, was very Imperfect; and there being noe means left to \n               suppress them,  it was thought fit to suffer them to be more correctly printed from the \n               last and truest Copies\u2019. According to a note in Tonson\u2019s hand in a copy of his edition \n                (N. & Q. 7th S.,XI,p.266), the editor of the present was Dr. Francis Atterbury who \n               had  borrowed the manuscript  from a Dr. Birch. The British Museum acquired in 1924 \n               a  copy of  Waller\u2019s Poems  1686 (C.28.c.12) which contains a transcript of Bishop \n                Atterbury\u2019s notes on a copy of the 1668 edition. \n                  Evidently  Bennet had  not taken the precaution of entering his copyright of the \n               unpublished  matter contained in this volume for, although he advertised the book in \n               the Term  Catalogue for November  1689 (Arber T.C. 11.288), Tonson entered his rights \n               to the text in the Stationers\u2019 Register the 24th of the same month. However, that act \n               had  apparently lost some of its effectiveness for, although the subsequent editions were \n               all published by Tonson, he had no expectation, according to the note quoted above, of \n               suppressing Bennet\u2019s unauthorized  edition. \n                  The prefatory essay in this volume has been reprinted in Smith's Seventeenth Century \n                Critical Essays. \n\n                 Groier   Crus W-P   III, 183, AsHLEy Car.

The Britwell copy of the first issue, in \n                            the British Museum,  has an unsigned engraved  frontispiece, folding, of the death of \n                            Dido on her pyre. If it belongs with this book it was apparently issued with few copies. \n                              The  Argument  reads in part: \u201c,.. This was done  (all but a very  little) by that \n                            incomparable person as well for virtue as wit, Mr.Sidney Godolphin only for his own \n                            divertion\u2019. Lines 455-585 have been regularly, since 1664, attributed to Waller; in the \n                            1711 edition of his works they are said to have been translated in 1657. Dighton in his \n                            edition of Godolphin\u2019s Poems  1930, suggests that \u2018Godolphin translated  the whole, \n                            and that Waller, in preparing the poem for publication, reworked the middle section \n                            to such an extant that he considered it his own\u2019. \n\n                                   tAt  line 455 (verso [D6], line 9) there is a paragraph sign which apparently  indicates the beginning  of \n                                      Waller's part. Line 585, however, if we have counted correctly, is in the middle of a sentence. \n\n                               Groier   Civ   W-P  III, 191.",

The head- \n                              piece with empty medallion flanked by birds having human  heads, though a common \n                              design, is known in this cutting in several books printed by Wardt and the floriated \n                              initials also are his. It is therefore apparent that at the time of the seizure Robinson \n                              had not begun to print this book. It was not until the following month that Cadman \n                              entered it in the Registers. \n                                Succeeding  editions of this poem were enlarged so that  from the  four books in \n                              twenty-two chapters of the present it finally included sixteen books in one hundred and \n                              seven chapters (see table of editions in Munro Shakespeare Allusion-Book  1 p.t59). \n                              However,  of all the editions this first remains the rarest, there being only four other \n                              copies known, viz. the Huntington (Ratcliffe-Dent-Heber-Corser-Addington-Hoe), the \n                              Folger (Jones-Chew), the Johns Hopkins  (presumably  that sold at the Pearson sale \n                              1916-White), and the Heber VIII-Britwell copy owned  by Gabriel  Wells. \n\n                                   tE.g.

It bears the title: \u2018Pan his Syrinx, or \n                                Pipe, Compact  of seuen Reedes: including in one, seuen Tragical and Comicall  Argu- \n\n                                                        [ 1094 ]\n\nments, with their diuers notes not impertinent: Whereby, in effect, of all thinges is \n               touched, in few, something of the vayne, wanton, proud, and inconstant course of the \n               World  . . . \u2019. It was dedicated to Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, the father of the \n               present dedicatee. Only three copies of that edition can be traced: the British Museum \n               (Heber), Dyce, and the Britwell-White (imperfect) copy now at the Rosenbach Co. \n                 Warner  complains  in his address prefixed to this edition: \u2018And (which somewhat \n               encourageth) one (in penning pregnenter, & a Scholler better than my selfe, on whose \n               graue the grasse now groweth green, whom  otherwise, though otherwise to me guiltie, \n               I name not) hath borrowed out of euery Calamus or Storie herein handled, Argument & \n               Inuention to seuerall Bookes by him published. An other of late, hauing (fayning the \n               same a Translation) set foorth an historie of a Duke of Lancaster, neuer before authored, \n               hath vouchsafed  (1 thanke him) to incerte therein euen whole Pages verbatim as they \n               are herein extant. For which their doing so farre off am I from detracting, as that I \n               holde my selfe much graced, in that they haue accompted my meere Inuention, Argu- \n               ments, and words worthy their vsurpation.\u2019. The first plagiarist Warner is here referring \n               to is obviously Robert Greene who, in the second part of his Never too late 1590, as well \n               as elsewhere, used plots which resemble some of Warner's. The other plagiarist is not \n               so easily identified although Warner is specific enough in his statements concerning \n               his work. It is possible that our difficulty arises from the fact that \u2018an historie of a \n               Duke  of Lancaster\u2019 is no longer extant. However, it is possible also that it was \u2018The \n               pleasant history of Edward Lord of Lancaster knight of the holy crosse with his adven- \n               tures &c\u2019 which John Danter entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register, 5 March 1593 (Arber \n               11.628) and which may  perhaps be identified with Henry Roberts\u2019s \u2018Honours conquest. \n               Wherein is conteined the famous hystorie of Edward of Lancaster recounting his honourable \n               trauailes to Jerusalem... with his passions and successe in loue; full of pleasant dis- \n               courses, and much varietie .. .\u2019. Roberts\u2019s book apparently survives only in the Douce \n               copy of an edition printed by Thomas  Creede in 1598, Danter being at that time in \n               difficulties and perhaps not able to protect his copyright. It has not been possible to \n               examine this book to see if it contains any plagiaries from Warner or if it purports to \n               be a translation. \n                 Copies of this second edition of the \u201cSyrinx\u2019 are of considerable rarity. We have been \n               able to trace only the British Museum (Roxburghe-Blandford), Dyce  (Charles Lamb- \n               Moxon),  Harmsworth   (Britwell, imperfect), and Huntington (Huth). \n\n                 S.T.C. 25087.

The most authoritative discussion seems to be based on the researches \n                           of H.D.Sykes presented in N.@&Q, 11 Series IX, pp.382,404,443,463. \n                             In 1874, Edmund  Gosse suggested that this play could be \u2018confidently and yet not \n                           rashly divided in detail between its two parents\u2019 and, in 1885, the portion which he \n                           ascribed to Webster was separately printed at the Daniel Press as Love\u2019s Graduate. \n                             In the same year that this was published Kirkman  also issued the first edition of \n                           The Thracian Wonder which he likewise attributed on the title to Webster and Rowley, \n                           an ascription which is doubtless erroneous.

This was \n                             possibly the Bindley copy (IV, 1820, Lot 600). \n\n                            Tue  importance of this book lies not alone in the fact that it contains the first direct \n                            reference to Shakespeare in contemporary literature (see Plate No.XLVs) but also be- \n                            cause it provides a clue, though one so elusive that it is more exasperating than helpful, \n                            to the obscure background  of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets. Acheson, Hughes  and  Harrison \n                            have all set forth ingenious theories regarding the characters and implications of this \n                            work but all are more or less dependent upon conjecture so that, for the present at least, \n                            the identity of the virtuous Avisa and her suitors, as well as the part played, or not \n                            played, by the enigmatic \u2018W.S.\u2019 must be regarded as interesting though unsettled. \n                               Evidently, however, the subject was not so obscure to the public of that day for, by \n                            1605, it appears to have passed through four editionst. Such a success would hardly \n\n                                    {The  edition of 1605 is declared on the title to be \u201cThe fourth time corrected and augmented.\u2019. No copies of \n                                       the second or third editions are known but from the fact that the new  epistle prefixed to the edition of \n                                       1635 is dated \u2018zo. of June, 1569\u2019 it is believed that the second edition was issued in 1596, the \u20181569\u2019 of \n                                       the 1635 edition being a misprint. However,  this still leaves unexplained the statement of that epistle \n                                       that this book was written \u2018thirtie and fiue yeeres since\u2019. The third edition is believed to have appeared \n                                       in 1599 because in that year (4 June) an edition was \u2018staid\u2019 in the Stationers\u2019 Hall (Arber III.679). \n\n                                      [ 1104 ]\n\nhave been possible were this book not tainted with some scandal as was, indeed, very \n               likely so for it was condemned by  the Archbishop of Canterbury  and the Bishop of \n               London. \n                 It is possible that, since the \u2018Authors Conclusion\u2019 ends with a \u2018FINIS\u2019, verso Q3, the \n               book was originally issued with Sig [Q4] a blank and that later sheet Q was again passed \n               through the press and the half-sheet R addedf. The  only evidence in support of this \n               conjecture is that two of the four extant copies lack these final leaves. \n                 The present is the only copy of this edition not in a public collection. Only two perfect \n               copies are known,  one in the British Museum  (Ames-George  III) and the other, the \n               Chalmers-Britwell, in the Folger Library. An imperfect copy, the Longe-Williams, is \n               also at the Folger\u2014the only library which possesses a complete set of the four known \n               editions. \n\n                   the   leaves (Q3-R2) which  are lacking in the present copy contain the last two stanzas of \u2018Avisa her last \n                     reply, Canto  72\u2019, recto Q3; \u201cThe Authors  Conclusion\u2019, verso; \u201cThe resolution of a chast and a constant \n                     wife\u2019, recto Qy-recto R; \u201cThe praise of a contented mind\u2019, verso R-recto Ra; colophon, recto Ra; blank, \n                     verso. \n\n                S.T.C. 25755.

The other dated edition and two of the \n               undated  ones have the same  signatures and pagination as the present and, from the \n               types used, these four might have been printed in London and possibly in the same \n\n          VOLE                     [ 1105 ]\n\nshopt. They contain the same poems, some  spurious, and in the same order as in the \n                          present but, since it has not been possible to compare them other than by facsimiles of \n                           their titles, no order of priority can be assigned. The other undated edition, however, \n                          because it is a contracted reprint with, according to Prinzf, an inferior text, is evidently \n                          not the earliest and may be a piracy though doubtless all the editions were surrepti- \n                           tiously published. \n                             The other dated  edition is known only from the Bliss-Lefferts-Purdy-Huntington \n                           copy. The title, reproduced Purdy sale catalogue, differs from the present by having \n                           acomma   at the end of the sixth line; the seventh line reads \u2018| E of R\u2014- |\u2019; the block of \n                           type-ornament consists of two rows of five pieces, the lower row being up-side down; \n                           and the imprint reads \u2018| Printed at ANTWERP,    1680. |\u2019.

It is rela~ \n                           tively common  and is a reprint of the present text. This same text was reprinted again \n                           in 1701, and 1702, but meanwhile  Tonson  had published, 1691, 1696, etc., Rymer\u2019s \n                           edition which presents a somewhat improved  text. \n\n  \n\n                                 tHarold  F. Brooks (Bid/. of 7.Oldham p.34) quotes a note by G.Thorn-Drury  in his interleaved copy of \n                                    Winstanley\u2019s Lives taken from The London Gazette, Nov. 22-5, 1680: \u2018Whereas there is a Libel of lewd \n                                   scandalous  Poems lately Printed, under the name of the Earl of Rochester, Whoever shall discover the \n                                    Printer to Mr. Thom L [sic] Cary, at the Sign of the Blew Boy in Cheap-Side, London, or to Mr. Will. \n                                    Richards at his house in Bow-Street Covent-Garden, shall have sl. reward.\u2019 As neither Cary nor Richards \n                                    were connected with the Stationers\u2019 Company it is probable that they were acting for Rochester\u2019s family \n                                    or, at any rate, for someone intent on protecting his literary reputation. That they suspected an English \n                                    printer is not, under the circumstances, proof of English printing. \n                                      In 1689, Benjamin Crayle and Joseph Streater were prosecuted by the Stationers\u2019 Company for printing \n                                    and publishing \u2018a notorious bawdy book\u2019, viz.

It is also possible that some editions were issued \n                           simultaneously. \n                              The two  editions which end  on Sig V6  (editions A and B  of first footnote) have \n                           usually been declared the earliest on the grounds that they are the only ones with a \n                           list of errata; because in them the text begins on Sig Br, whereas in the others it begins \n                           on  recto B7; and presumably  also, because the edition of 1614 ends with sheet X as \n                           do the other three dated 1613. However,  the same errors noted in the lists in editions \n                           A  and B occur  in the text of the other editions uncorrected except for some obvious \n                           ones, and the presence of the errata lists may be due merely to the fact that editions \n                           Aand   Bare the only ones with pagination. The fact that the text begins on Sig Br may \n                           be  due to compression  though any  argument  along those lines is precarious for the \n                           edition of 1615, unlike the other 1613 editions and that of 1614, also has text beginning \n                           on  recto B and ends with sheet V. \n                              The edition (S.T.C. 25894) which has the addition \u2018Also the Scourge. Epigrams\u2019 on \n                           the  title is like the two editions, A and B, in having the second line of the English \n                           quotation  on the title in roman, and a necessarily inadequate collation indicates that, \n                           where  that edition differs from the present, it usually is closer to editions A and B. \n                            Consequently, if a thorough collation should confirm the priority of A or B it would \n                           probably  place the present edition fourth, i.e. the last of the legitimate 1613 editions. \n                              It has been frequently asserted that an edition of this work was printed as early as. \n                            1611, and a large number of apparent references to it have been gleaned from Wither\u2019s \n                           later works{{. There seems to be little foundation for this belief for not only is no copy \n                           known   to exist, but the book was first entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register the 16th \n                           January  1613, and a careful reading of the passages cited above fails to disclose a direct \n                           statement  that this book was actually printed at that earlier date rather than merely \n                           circulated in manuscript. \n\n                                 tfSee particularly an unpublished thesis by J.M.French  in Harvard  University Library  and  P.M.L.A. \n                                   XLV   (1930) p.959- \n\n                              S.T.C. 25892.

Presumably, however, it was licensed by the ecclesiastical authorities \n              for no trouble seems to have occurred in that respect, but it is rather doubtful if Wither \n              actually set-up the type for this work himself as he claims in the note on verso fol. 14 \n              for this is a Jeremiad of more than 20,000 lines and, as an apprentice compositor, it \n              would  probably  have  taken him  much  longer to set-up than  it took him to write. \n               Elsewhere, he states that four thousand copies were printed so that the printing was a \n              task that must  have engaged  a whole printing office for sometime. There is, however, \n              little hope of identifying the printer\u2014Grismond   apparently merely  acted as agent, \n               Wither being the publisher. According to Birch (Charles I, Vol. 1 p-367), copies sold \n               for nearly five shillings. \n                 \u2018The final quarter-sheet, signed \u2018#\u2019, is known in two settings, possibly simultaneous. \n               In one, e.g. the present, the text is in italic, whereas the other, e.g. the Harvard, is set \n              jn roman.  Since the text of verso [&12] is set in italic it is possible that the setting in \n               roman type was  an error and only a few of the earliest copies issued have it. All three \n              of the British Museum   copies have the italic setting. \n                 A manuscript,  entitled \u2018The History of the Pestilence, 1625\u2019, of which this is an \n               enlarged version, has recently been  printed from  the copy at  Magdalene  College, \n               Cambridge,  edited J.M.French. \n\n                  fit was entered by Robert White, 28 March  1644 (Eyre I, p.108), unless, as is unlikely, the entry which \n                    reads \u2018Britains Remembrancer\u2019 was made  for the anonymous attack on Wither, \u2018Withers Remembrancer, \n                    or Extracts from...

Extracts from the present were published in 1643 and 1683, and with the \n                    first the author may have been concerned. It is entitled \u2018Mr. Wither his prophesie\u2019 and consists of two \n                                              ason dated 16th February 1642-3.

If they are the same and if \n                           it was the author's intention to imply that they had been published at the time he \n                           wrote that they had been considered \u2018ouer Cynical\u2019, then this book must  have been \n                           published in 1613 for the first edition of Abuses stript and whipt is dated 1613. The \n                           Abuses was  entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register 13 January 1613, while the present \n\n                                   Mentioned   in the second Epithalamion, ls,  recto C3, \n                                     Stript and whipt. \n                                   tQuoted from  Il.1-3 of \u201cTo the Christian Readers\u2019, \n\n                                                                                       and there identified by a marginal note as Abuses \n\n                                     [ 1120 ]\n\nwas  not entered until 10 February  1613ff, i.e. four days before the event which it \n           celebrates. \n             This  little book contains some of Wither\u2019s most charming verse. It was evidently \n           appreciated by the royal couple whom it celebrates for there is a tradition that Wither \n           was  released from the Marshalsea  by their intercession when he was imprisoned for \n           the freedom  of his Abuses. Copies of this Epithalamia are very uncommon. In fact it \n           has been  called \u2018the rarest of all Wither\u2019s works\u2019. Copies are in the British Museum, \n            University Library Cambridge,  Harmsworth  (Huth),  Morgan, and  Harvard (White) \n            Libraries. \n\n              {The  entry was made  by William Welby and the title then given is very much the same as that which was \n                printed. However, Welby  paid no fee and one might perhaps infer from that circumstance that the entry \n                was not consummated  because Welby had sold his rights to Marchant, were it not that, 15 February 1613, \n                John Trundle entered Thomas  Heywood\u2019s  4  mariage triumphe solemnized in an Epithalamium, for which \n                he paid the usual fee although the book bears the imprint: \u2018Printed for Edward Marchant . . . '. Prob- \n                ably, therefore, in both these cases, Marchant was merely the agent and the imprints should read as does \n                the imprint of Dekker\u2019s If it be not good, the divel is in it which is: \u2018Printed for I.T[rundle].

Wither apparently was provoked by Walk- \n             ley\u2019s action to edit his early lyrical productions and to allow the collection to be pub- \n             lished by John Budge}  in 1622. \n               As then issued the imprint on the engraved title read: \u2018LONDON | printed for Iohn | \n             Budge  in pauls\u2019 Church | yard at y* figne of the | green dragon | 1622 |\u2019 (reproduced \n             Grolier Club W-P  II  p.259). The unsold copies passed, after Budge\u2019s death, 1625, to \n             Allott who reissued them  with that imprint altered to read as in present. He did not, \n             however, consider it worth while to cancel the part titles which all retain the imprint: \n             \u2018... Printed by T.S. for Iohn Budge . . . 1622\u2019. \n               The  direction to the binder on recto [Qq8] reads: \u2018Place thefe laft 4. pages after the \n             braffe Frontifpice, before the Title of Abufes Stript and Whipt.\u2019, and on the same page \n             is the catchword \u2018ABVSES\u2019.   Usually copies occur in which these directions have been \n             followed, and as the blank Sig A  is usually lacking the collation frequently given is: \n             AS, \u00a7  (placed after Sig [A]), B-P\u00a7, Qq\u00b0. \n               We  have traced five copies of this edition bound like the present with the Motto 1621, \n             and Faire-Virtue  1622. As they  were published  by other booksellers it is not clear \n             whether the combination  is a publisher\u2019s or a chance purchaser\u2019s. \n             t\u00a5rans.

Copies of all, including two issues of \n                            the first, are in the British Museum.  Their order of publication and  distinguishing \n                            features are as follows: \n                              The  first issue of the first edition (S.T.C.25925) has, instead of an engraved title, a \n                            printed one reading: \u2018[in double-rules] WITHER\u2019S   | MOTTO.    | Nec habeo, nec Careo, \n                            nec Curo. | Anno Domini | [rule] | CID 1D CXXI.  |\u2019, recto [A], verso blank. This leaf is \n                            clearly conjugate with Sig [A8]. The second  issue (B.M.11630.aa.13, not  recorded in \n                            the S.1.C.) is the same  as the first except that the printed title is cancelled and a \n                            quarter-sheet substituted, one leaf of which contains the  engraved  title in the first \n                            state, without the imprint; and the other, \u2018The Explanation of the Embleme\u2019. \n                              The  second edition ($.T.C.25924) collates as the second issue of the first edition but \n                            the imprint, noted above, has been added  to the engraved  title, i.e. the second state. \n                              The  third edition (B.M.238.b.20, imperfect) is not recorded in the $.7.C. To it for \n                            the first time has been  appended  \u2018A  Poft-fcript\u2019t, Sig [F3-4], although \u2018FINIS\u2019  is \n                            retained at the end of \u2018An Epigram\u2019 on verso F2, while no catchword has been supplied \n                            there. \n                              The  fourth edition (S.T.C.25927)  is a line-for-line reprint of the third except for \n                            Sig [F3-4], \u20184 Poft-[cript\u2019, which is from the same setting in both. It appears to be later \n                            than the third edition because, in place of the \u2018FINIS\u2019 at bottom of verso Fa, it has a \n\n                                  {Wither states therein that \u2018twenty daies are past since vp Ihung My bold Impreza\u2019 which, roughly, perhaps \n                                    indicates the date of this edition. \n\n                                       [ 1124 ]\n\ntOther distinguishing marks are: \n                                                            \u2018THIRD EDITION    FOURTH  EDITION \n\n                                          Verso B2, line 12   Ieaft              jeaft \n                                          Verso Ba, line 20    \u2018Hyperboles       Hyporboles \n                                          Verso B3, line 13    Country, Prince   Countrey  Prince \n                                          Recto C3, lines      Bowle             bowle \n                                          Recto C3, line 18   me                 mee \n                                          Recto C3, line 20    abundance         aboundance \n                                          Recto C4, line 10   or                 as \n                                          Recto C4, line 13    Fame              fame \n                 ttAt his examination before the Privy Council Grismond  stated that he thought \u2018Withers\u2019 motto was only \n                   questioned because printed without  licence from the Stationers\u2019 Company ...\u2019. And Thomas   Trussell, \n\n                  a messenger of His Majesties Chamber,  stated that \u2018On July 7, Mr Oakes, the printer, told him he had \n                  done  nothing about  Withers\u2019 book without consent of the Stationers\u2019 Company, who will procure his \n                  discharge if he be committed\u2019.

Taverner was sum \n                  moned  at the same time but dismissed the following day. Wither was not released for nearly a year and \n                  then only after severe treatment, see P.M.L.d. XLV (1930) pp.950-1. Grismond and Marriott were also \n                  committed  to the Marshalsea  the same day but were enlarged roth July 1621, after examination, Acts \n                  of P.C. 1621-3, p.12. \n\n           VOL.II                         [ 1125 ]\n\nMeads  in a letter to Sir Martin Stuteville states: \u2018Withers, for his motto, is in the \n                         Marshalsea; the king threatening to pare his whelps\u2019 claws. . .\u2019. \n                           The  Privy Council finally, roth July 1621, examined Marriott, Grismond and Okes\u2014 \n                         Mathewes  apparently was never brought before them. As was usual then, the stationers\u2019 \n                         testimony (St. P. Dom. James I, 10 and 12 July 1621, Pp-274-5) obviously was not the \n                         \u2018whole truth\u2019 but some  of their statements are not without interest. Marriott, for \n                         instance, testified that Wither\u2019s Moffo was not called in question till the first impression \n                         was sold and  the second preparing, which Mr. Taverner  licensed, after striking out \n                         certain passages. That he never sold any copies since, but they were printed and sold \n                         by Nicholas Okes. The  latter asserted that he printed the book from a printed copy, \n                         not knowing  it was unlicensed. That he bought the title-page [i-e. the copper plate] \n                         ready printed, with Marriott\u2019s name on it, and used it without his consent. Grismond \n                         declared that Okes printed and sold 6000 copies after the Stationers\u2019 Company  had \n                         fined Marriott [and him also]. That he, Grismond, sold many  copies of the book to \n                         Humphrey   Lowndes,  warden of the Stationers\u2019 Company who daily sent for them even \n                         after he had accused and fined him and Marriott for publishing them. \n                           All this apparently served to aid the sale of the book for according to Wither, who \n                         had been paid only \u2018five pieces\u2019 for the copy, \u2018about Thirty Thousand Copies . . . were \n                         sold in a few months\u2019 (Fragmenta Prophetica quoted in Wrangham   Cat. p.519). \n\n                           S.T.C. 25928.

The Chew-Huntington copy has both the \n                          printed and engraved titles. The printed title is on paper with the same unicorn water- \n                          mark  used predominantly   throughout the volume;  whereas  the engraved  title is on \n                          paper which  differs from the rest. It is, therefore, not unlikely that the earliest copies \n                          were  issued with the printed title while Okes was awaiting the prints from Delaram\u2019s \n                          shop.  The printed title was probably  conjugate with an  unsigned  blank leaf. The \n                           Wrenn copy, in original vellum, is said to have such a leaf following the engraved title. \n                             According to the errata, p.148, \u2018in some few Copies\u2019 a few \u2018faults, escaped at the \n                           Presse\u2019. In the present, two of the six errors there listed are corrected while the three \n                          noted on  verso [As] are all uncorrected. \n                             Nicholas Okes was  fined 20 shillings \u2018for printing a booke called a Preparation to \n                          the  Psalter with out the Consent of the wardens\u2019 (Court-Book C  56%, 20 July 1619). \n                           This apparently had nothing to do with Wither\u2019s later quarrel with the Company but \n                          merely meant  that Okes had neglected to enter the book, an omission he rectified, 13th \n                           August 1619. \n\n                               ft reads: \u2018A | PREPARATION    | To the Pfalter. | By George Wyther.

The author was given as \u2018A. B.\u2019 when this title was entered \n             in the Stationers\u2019 Register, 18th December 1612, by Francis Burton. There is no record \n             of the transfer of the rights in this work to Johnson and presumably, they were not \n             transferred for, in 1617, Burton republished this work with the Abuses stript and whipt. \n             Therefore, despite the imprint, apparently Johnson} was merely  Burton\u2019s agent. \n                Copies of this tract are less common than are most of the elegiac tracts by comparable \n             poets on  Prince Henry\u2019s death.

The title read \n              as in the present  through the  ninth line, and thereafter: \u2018ANNO   | MDXIIII.   |\u2019. \n              Whether  that was  a fragment  of a collected edition, or a genuine unknown edition, \n              earlier and perhaps less extensive than the present, cannot be determined until that \n              copy is recovered. \n                The  variant reading of the title cited by Lowndes, Hoe and the D.N.B. cannot  be \n              supported by  any copy of which we  can find record. \n\n               S.T.C. 25916.

WITHER.\u2019f. \n                            The chronological order of these editions, however, is another matter for while it can \n                          be shown that the present was printed from a partially corrected copy of the Snodham- \n                          Wyther edition there is no evidence to prove that the Snodham-Wither edition was \n                          printed from a corrected copy of the present or even at a later time. In fact, it would \n                          seem more likely that the demand for this book proved to be so great that Norton \n                          commissioned both White and Snodham   to print editions more or less simultaneously \n                          and that he provided them with corrected copies of the earlier Snodham edition. \n                            According to the postscript, \u2018if you thinke it hath not vvell answered the Title of \n                          the Shepheards Hunting, goe quarrell with the Stationer, who bid himselfe God-father, \n                          and imposed the Name  according to his owne liking\u2019, for the preceding Michaelmas \n                          Term when  the poem was authorized and entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register through \n                          the \u2018paynes\u2019 of well-disposed friends it bore the name \u2018Thirsis huntinge day\u2019. \n\n                               Table  of textual corrections: \n\n                                                         8.25920                     $.25922 (present)          $.25921 \n                                 Recto A3, in heading   _piuately                   priuatly                    priuately \n                                 Recto B3, line 7       talk\u2019t                     talk\u2019t                       walk\u2019t \n                                 Recto Ba, lines 15-6    [not indented]             [indented]                  [indented] \n                                 Recto By, line 7       bolts of fteele              Bolt's of fteele           bolts of fteele \n                                 Recto C2, line 8       Mewes                       Newes                       Newes \n                                 Recto C3, Hine 12     woe                          woe                         wooe \n                                 Recto C4, Hine 11     despe                       despe                        deepe \n                                 Recto C5, line 7      hauiug                      hauing                       hauing \n                                 Recto C6, line 8       Two  couple more  of a       Two  couple more of a      Two  couple more  of a \n                                                        larger Race [metre lacks _   far larger Race,           farre larger Race, \n                                                        one syllable] \n                                 Recto D4, Hine 18      [ends] abide, [to rhyme      abide                      abide them. \n\n                                                          with \u2018befide them\u2019] \n\n                             S.T.C. 25922.

His clerical bent is \n                           readily discernible in the text which resembles the old religious moralities in everything \n                           except the mingling of historical characters with allegorical ones and in the power of \n                           its denunciation of things not Protestant. It is, wherever the speeches are long enough \n                           to permit, written in seven-line stanzas. \n                             The  only other copy of the present issue is the Douce copy in the Bodleian. There \n                           are, on the other hand, at least eight copies of the second issue.

Though Warton condemns Wotton as a poet, some of the \n                          verse, as for example the hymn to the Virgin, is quite simple and charming and all, \n                          even  the rudest rhymes, have a swing and naivet\u00e9 which make them readable. \n                             The \u2018Vrankenbergh\u2019 of the colophon has been identified by Duff as a Henry Franken- \n                           bergh who, in partnership with a certain Barnard van Stondo, was, in 1482, a merchant \n                          of printed books with a shop in an alley in St. Clement\u2019s Lane, called St. Mark\u2019s Alley. \n                             Manuscript copies of this work are quite common, Carleton Brown lists thirty and \n                           there are several others.

III. 481), Jeffrey Wale advertised this \n              book as being printed for himself. As it was originally published by subscription, evi- \n              dently Wale took over the remainder copies to which he affixed a new title with imprint \n              reading: \u2018London | Printed for Ieffrey Wale, at the Angel in St. Paul\u2019s | Church-Yard, \n              1706. |\u2019 (e.g. Hoe Cat. V,1905,p.160). When this volume was printed apparently a sec- \n              ond volume  was contemplated  for the text ends, p.438, with the statement \u201cThe End \n            of  the Firft Volume.\u2019. In the present copy, as in most, this is concealed under a correc- \n              tion-slip which reads \u2018THE END.\u2019. \n                According to the auction records there are in existence at least ten other presentation \n              copies of this book on large-paper. Still other copies said to be on large-paper are re- \n              corded but without definite information as to their dimensions. The present copy, judg- \n              ing by the descriptions of the others, is probably the finest known as regards condition \n              and of considerable interest from its association with the Earl of Radnor, the nephew of \n              the Countess of Drogheda\u2014   Wycherley\u2019s first wife. \n                Except  for the piece \u2018Upon the Idleness of Business\u2019 the contents of this volume do \n              not appear to have  been reprinted except in the Nonesuch  collected edition of this \n              author. Though  on the whole this neglect is justifiable there is in the luxury of these \n              spacious sheets, when contrasted with their ribald contents, something of the atmos- \n              phere of the court of the second Charles. \n\n               Grouier  Cus    W-P  III, 298.

Plomer Dict. 1668-7725 p.31)- \n                               It is this comedy, \u2018almost unique in its age\u2019, which typified the author to his con- \n                            temporaries and  also, apparently, to himself.

According to the \n                            dedication the translation was made about five years before by a \u2018gentleman for his \n                            private delight\u2019. Yonge obtained a transcript from him but not permission to publish. \n                            He composed  his accompaniment  at that time and was later induced to print both his \n                            and the anonymous  gentleman\u2019s work  only because he had learned that it was about \n                            to be printed from imperfect transcripts. Yonge\u2019s story is not very convincing but it \n                            is all the evidence available. \n                              Grove  states that the word \u2018madrigal\u2019 was introduced to the English language on \n                            this title and his assertion is supported by the N.\u00a3.D.

The portions omitted are for \n                   the most part of no great consequence or are repeated in other letters of that period which \n                   have  been printed. \n                 3 Evelyn,  according to his draft reply, received Bentley's first letter the day after he wrote \n                   the letter to which the present refers. \n                 4 Evelyn  was  co-trustee with Archbishop  Tenison of the Boyle Lectures to which Bentley \n                   here refers. \n                 5 Francis  Gastrell, later Bishop of Chester, was the successful candidate, Bentley preached \n                   the first Lecture Sermons after the foundation of this famous lectureship in 1691. \n                 6 The  work  here referred to is presumably Evelyn\u2019s Numismata published this same year. \n                 7 Benjamin   Tooke, bookseller at Middle Temple  Gate, Fleet Street. \n                 8 Bishop  Edward   Stillingfleet. \n                 g Stillingfleet\u2019s second wife, Elizabeth daughter of Sir Nicholas Pedley, died early this same \n                   year. \n                 10 Bentley was the initiator of the renovation of the Cambridge University Press at this time. \n                   He  was,  however, somewhat   over optimistic about the type which he had  ordered from \n                   Holland  for it did not arrive until 28 January 1698 (cf. S.C.Roberts 4 History of the Cam- \n                   bridge University Press p-77)- \n                 11 Samuel Pepys. \n                 12 This \u2018Iobb\u2019 was  presumably  his \u2018Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris, etc.\u2019 which \n                    Bentley appended  to the second edition of Dr. William Wotton\u2019s Reflections upon Ancient \n                   and  Modern  Learning published in the spring of 1697. \n                 13 Presumably  one of the early editions of Bentley's Boyle Lectures which usually appeared \n                   under  the title \u2018The Folly and Unreasonableness of Atheism\u2019. \n                 14 Bentley is here referring to his edition of Callimachi fragmenta collecta published in the \n                    Utrecht edition edited by J.G.Graevius, 1697.",

And  indeed, I did not receiue a little fatisfaction, in hearing \n                            that you, & your good ffamily were in health: I am fure wee haue often talk\u2019d of you \n                            with much  delight; & many times haue we wish\u2019d you  here with us, where you would \n                            be really welcome, if I should liue to injoy fuch happiness, nothing being more accept- \n                            able then your felf. S; I haue try\u2019d your ingenious experiment  of preserving fome \n                            flowers in fand in their naturall colour, & it fucceeds beyond what I expected. I haue \n                            likewise made an essay to preserue them, in dipping fome, & fprinkling others of their \n                            leavs, especially Tulips which are most difficult, in Aqua fortis, fpirit of wine, & {pirit \n                            of vitriol, & putting them afterwards in fand; which has this effect that fome part of \n                            the leavs does mell [sic], & other parts are discolour\u2019d: I presume, by reason that the \n                            fpirit does not equally take each part of the leavs, tho I haue indeauour\u2019d to apply it \n                            as aboue. I haue likewise infus\u2019d the leavs into each fpirit; being in a fhort time con- \n                            fumed  in the Aqua fortis; they lose all their colour, & most of their fubstance in the \n                            fpirit of wine; but retain in the fpirit of vitriol, their colour a little fading: which I \n                            fuppose may  be improu\u2019d by the mixture now  vs'd for varnish.

That when Secretary Turietta brought the Message \n            to the Duke at the Viadores, which he {related ?} priuately to him the Duke imediately \n            called the Viadore aloud & acquainted him with the Message he had resiud & defird \n            he would  be a witnes to his answer, which was this That Mons\" Turietta should tell \n            his Ex! from him that the reason why he had at any time sett his foot within the Court \n            since his Ex!! came to the Government, was because it was the King his Masters house, \n            but that for y\u00ae future whilst he stayd in the Gouernment he would forbear coming. \n            Howeuer  he would still continue to serue his Mat & to carry his Batton in hopes, when \n            he was out of his Gouernment to giue him cent coup de Baton with it. This relacon were \n            scarse credible, if it came not from a hand that cannot be mistaken hauing had it from \n            his mouth that defcried it. Its thought upon return of the Gentleman whom the Duke \n            has sent Express to Madrid that he will leaue this Country & return to Spayn with his \n            Family. \n              This morning  his Ex!! had notice that Genr!!

But as the Deputies themselus \n                          say, they cannot imagine where this mony will be found after they haue agreed for that \n                          their taxes haue been so high during the Warr & now particularly this yeer, that there \n                          is scarce a C\u00e9siderable Village in Flanders w*h is not morgaged to the Bankiers at \n                          Antwerp,  some for 40, some 50 & some for 60 thousand florins wh they are ingaged \n                          to repay out of their Subsidies so that they know not which way to turn themselus for \n                          raising what will be expected from them.

It is not surprising, therefore, to find the substance of part of this \n                   letter included in the Gazette No.937, \u2018From Monday November 9. to Thursday November \n                   12. 1674\u2019 under the date-line \u2018Bruffels, November 16.\u2019. Other parts of the news contained \n                   in this appear to have either been duplicated from other sources or rewritten under other \n                   date-lines. However, the major part of the court gossip of Brussels is omitted as well as \n                   the purely local news, perhaps merely on account of the limitations of space. The present \n                   letter is marked received the 16th (Old Style) and the 6th (Gregorian). One would therefore \n                   expect it to have been used for No.938 (16 November) but no news is there included from \n                   Brussels. \n                 2 This letter is stated by Morrison to be from the Leeds Papers and therefore presumably is \n                   from the MSS.  of the Duke of Leeds at Hornby Castle Yorkshire which contain news-letters \n                   to Secretary Williamson among  the papers of Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby. \n                 3 Charles IJ, then 13 years of age. \n                 4 Count  de Monterey. \n                 5 This was  Turenne\u2019s opportunity  and, against the advice of Louis XIV and Louvois, he \n                   carried out in December  his brilliant Vosges campaign.",

In those proceedings Dr. Dale was, from March 1573 \n                           until 1576, a principal agent, being during that period Elizabeth\u2019s ambassador resident \n                           in France. \n                             While  the story of d\u2019Alencon\u2019s courting can be followed in the archives of both \n                           France and England  in great detail, nevertheless it is still somewhat difficult to judge \n                           of the sincerity of the parties personally concerned. For example we find Elizabeth, \n                           in the second of these letters, protesting that she is utterly ignorant and innocent of \n                           the expedition of the Comte de Montgomery  for the relief of Rochelle and yet among \n                           the State Papers in the Public Record Office is still preserved sufficient evidence to \n                           show that the Queen was directing Dr. Dale to illustrate the truth of Wotton\u2019s epigram \n                           that \u2018An ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the benefit of his country\u2019. \n                           However,  this apparent dishonesty was practised with equal vigor by the French, e.g. \n                           in the matter of De Verac, and no doubt was discounted by both parties. \n                             The  letters here preserved are the originals which Dr. Dale received in Paris (the \n                           precis of the fourth is preserved in the Public Records Office) but of course they give \n                           only a fragment of one side of the story. It may be followed with more breadth of view \n                           in Martin  Hume\u2019s  The  Courtships of Queen Elizabeth and in the other histories of \n                           Elizabethan diplomacy.  But for many of the details one must still, as stated above, \n                           turn to the archives in London and Paris. \n                             Though  all of these letters are issued under Elizabeth\u2019s sign-manual, and all but one \n                           (MS.15)  still bear her sealt, they were almost certainly not composed by her but by \n                           her counsellors. One (MS.15) was written and countersigned by her Secretary of State, \n                           Sir Thomas  Smith;  another (MS.17)  can be proved  to have been  drafted by Lord \n                           Burghley; and in answering them  Dr. Dale wrote sometimes to the Queen, and some- \n                           times to Burghley or Walsingham, and  not infrequently to all of them. \n                             Five of these items, the letter dated 21 May 1573 (MS.15) not being among them, \n                           were sold in 1859, as Lot 157 of the Dawson  Turner  sale. At that time they were \n                           preserved in a volume half bound in calf. The collection was bought by M.M.Holloway \n                           for John Dillon at whose sale, in 1869, they were again bought by the same agent who \n\n                                  TMS.14 is a safe-conduct for an early embassy of Dr. Dale, while MS.19 was addressed to him in France \n                                    after the d\u2019Alencon negotiations had ceased.

To wh \n             being aunfwered  by the Quene mother, than we fhuld fpedely aunfwer to the matter of \n             thaffurance for his comyng. \n             Touching  our ayding  of the king of Scottes and the ftaying of de virac here*, and that \n             he did fay that by  of laft treatie we fhuld joyne in all thinges w\u00b0h wer to be don for \n             the pacifieing of that countrey. and neither of vs do anything feverally: we aunfwered \n             that on our parte ther was  lefte nothing vndon that we could do for the pacifieing of \n              the troubles there. And as the king had before tymes had virac there and afterwards \n              fent la Crocq$ thither: So had we alfo fent the marfhall of Barwick\u00ae & after Henry \n              Killigrew\u2019. But whan  they  bothe wer gon, du  Crocq  & virac and Henry Killigrew \n              remayning  ftill there at the requeft of the Regent* & the nobilitie in Scotland in the \n              kinges name, in hope of a full peace & accord to be fhortely concluded amonges them, \n              they did emongeft  themfelfes appoint Coihiffion's who at fst John{townes? did con- \n              clude and accord all controverfies betwixt the Regent and the lordes who then profeffed \n              their obedience to the king on the one parte, and therle of Huntley!\u00ae & the Hamiltons \n              & all other wh  wer on the cdtrary part. So that by that accord all the noble men & \n              other {tates of Scotland came to draw nye one lyne and grow  to gither in one entier \n              body  & parfit amitie amongeft themfelfes and in obedience to the king, and the fame \n              alfo eftabliffhed and enacted in their full parlament wherof you may fay that we could \n              not but be glad ffor it was that w'h bothe we did alwayes defire and as we take it the \n              french king alfo and w\u00b0h was pretended {pially in our laft treatie w\u2018 the faid king. That \n              to that ende we  fhuld bothe ioinctely travell by of meffengers and ambaffadours to \n              bring to paffe and otherwife ther is no claufe in the treatie to forbid either of vs a part \n              to furder vnitie & comon peace in Scotland fo as the fending of Killigrew thither alone \n              at the defire of the {tates of the realme is nothing againft the treatie. And now in this \n              meane  while  came  firft out of ffraunce one James Kircauldy\"! the lord of Granges \n              brother as appereth by his own c\u00e9feffion & les of his own writing wt money & inftruc- \n              tions directly to hinder & let that c\u00e9mon accord fo moche as might be and to encorage \n              thofe fewe of the caftell notw'ftanding the whole nobilitie of the realme wer otherwife \n              accorded, to contynew  in their obftinacie and rebellion againft their king & the reft of \n              the {tate and fo to contynew  ftill a civill warre affirming that ther was an other of \n              more  credit that fhuld come  fhortly after from the king w* more ample inftructions \n              and  ayde for the fame purpofe.

And though we can not as yet here that they \n                          in Scotland do affent to his comyng: yet vpon continewance of thambaffadors requeft \n                          and  feing the faid de virac is fo defirous to go thither w* affirmation that he will not \n                          hinder the cSmon  peace there wer we content to let him have a paffeport to paffe to \n                           Barwik and fo farre as we have any jurifdicion.

In this fort briefly you may fee how we haue proceedid in \n                           this mater. Whiche when you haue well confiderid, we requyre you to declare the fame \n                           to the king and to the Queene moother. And to require them that they will think the \n                           better of our good meaning in that we deale thus plainely wth them. And yet we leaue \n                           the further confideracion herof to them felfes. Meaning certenly both in this and in all \n                           other thinges to be anfwerable to them in all good offices that may conferue ot amitie \n                           with them. Th\u2019ambaffadot alfo told vs that he perceavid that Edward Horfey had not \n                           dealt with the king nor his mother for declaracion of our doinges in Scotland. Whervnto \n                           we anfwerid, that in deede of faid feriiut told vs that the fault was not in him. for, as \n                           you cafi tell, there was no motion made by them therof to him nor to you. for if there \n                           had, you were both directid to haue fully fatiffyed the king. And for the more Iuftifi- \n                           cacion of our intent herin, We told him that Horfey talking with the Queene mother of \n                           other thinges, vpon occafion offrid by the Queene Mother in prayfing our governement \n                           for the happines therin, he made a {peciall mention to fhew our finceritie in of actions \n                           not onely at home but in other Contrees. How of late we had procurid a good peace in \n                           Scotland, ceaffid their civill warres, and reftorid to the king his ftrongift Caftell of \n                           Edinburgh, deteynid by  Rebells. And though we might  haue impatronizid  our felfes \n                           therof, yet w'out feeking to haue any intereft in that Realme in any thing, we yeldid \n                           to the king all thinges to our great charge. To whiche his fpeeche the Queene mother \n                           feemid to applaud, onely cOmending vs in fo doing, wttout demaunding  any  further \n                          queftion. And fo th\u2019ambaffado' might pler]ceaue where the lack was that in that matter \n                           no furder declaracion was made. But at his requeft we will that you fhall take occafion \n                           to fpeake heerof to the king, or to his mother. and lett them fee our finceritie in that \n                          mater. Wherin  it is manifeft that we fought altogether the pacificacion of that Realme \n                           and not of owii proffit. No, we haue not taken that avantage that we might, and that \n                          of progenitors in lyke tymes wold haue done. that is, fo to bynde that Realme and {tate \n                          to vs in ftreight amitie, that it fhuld diffolue their leagues with that Crowne of ffrafice. \n\n                                     [ 1194 ]\n\nWhich we  mynde  not to doo, in refpect of the good amitie that we meane to keepe with \n             that Crowne of ffrance our felfes. and fo can be content there be and remayne a mutuall \n             frendfhip betwixt vs all three, without intention that either of vs fhuld feeke the preiu- \n             dice or damaige of the other. And as long as that Crowne of ffrance fhall meane none \n             other, there neede be no doubt of our Intencion otherwife to deale with Scotland but \n             as we haue done. And  this you may  well affure them. \n             Thambaffado'  alfo movid vs to graunt lycence to a Gentleman whom the ffrenche king \n             wold fend into Scotland to vifit the king. Whervnto we affentid. Adding that therby \n             the king fhuld well vnderftand,  (if the party wold deale well being there,) how fin- \n             cerely we had dealt in this our late actions in Scotland. And fo you may tell the king. \n             If you fhall fynd it convenient to the furderance of the late reconciliacion of them of \n             the Religion to the king, that our cOmendation and well lyking therof may doo good, \n             or that our Requeft in {ome pointes reafonable to furdre the fame to fome more benefite \n             and furely [sic] for them, you fhall vfe your difcretion to fay fomewhat to the king in \n             our name,  for the one or the other. ffor the more they fhalbe avancid in their libertie \n             for their exercife of their Religion and for their furety the gladder we wold be.

This omission may have been deliberate for Sorbiere, not only through his \n                                    friendship with Hobbes,  but particularly for his disrespect to the Society in his Relation \n                                    d'un  Voyage en Angleterre 1663, and his tactless references to Evelyn\u2019s friend and patron, \n                                     Clarendon, was later not highly regarded either by the Society as a whole or by Evelyn \n                                    in particular, cf.

This coming from you, will mortifie their Confidence; \n               and  let them know  \u2019tis the pure Indulgence of the Family they fo vnworthily have \n               affronted, that you refent it not in the higheft meafure it will beare; & that Officers \n               who  are plac\u2019d here to mind his M\u00a2?

The text there printed is \n                                        somewhat  different from the present, and, as the subject of the letter is of some interest to \n                                        students of English collecting, the original text is here given in full.

In that letter the portraits listed contain eighteen names not in the \n                     present while there are nineteen here listed which do not appear there. The present list also \n                     is not quite the same as that in this letter as printed in Evelyn's Correspondence. \n                   8 Clarendon  House, see Diary, 18 September 1683, where it is recorded that the building after \n                     being sold by  Clarendon\u2019s son  to the Duke of  Albemarle was resold to a syndicate for \n                     speculative building. \n                   g The first English book auction occurred in 1676. \n                  10 See Barlow\u2019s letter to Evelyn, 10 June 1661, regarding the loss by the printer of the MS. of \n                     Evelyn\u2019s translation of Nauddeus. \n                  11 It was bought by  George I for Cambridge  University and, from present standards, may be \n                     ranked ahead  of any of the libraries of printed books here mentioned. \n                  12 Tenison\u2019s Library in St. Martin\u2019s was kept intact until 1861 when it was sold for the benefit \n                     of the parish school. At that time it amounted to about three thousand books and seventy \n                     MSS.,  the former mostly of the seventeenth century, see Edwards Founders I,p.261. \n                  13 Evelyn appears  to have lost touch with his friend the Earl of Berkeley, if the records at Sion \n                     College are correct, for in 1682 he presented several thousand of these books to that library, \n                     see Rye Libraries of London p.182, and E.H.Pearce Sion College and Library pp.258-260. \n                  14 In this letter as printed in the Correspondence it is declared that the executors of Vossius\u2019s \n                     estate \u2018have since carried them back into Holland, where they expect a quicker market\u2019, \n                     Hearne  records in his Religuiae, 10 October 1710, that he had just heard that the library \n                     had been sold in Leyden. The University of Oxford offered \u00a33000 for the library but in vain, \n                  15 His library is said to have been the foundation of the Dysart collection at Ham House. \n                  16 Pepys  retired from the secretaryship in February of this year. \n                  17 Pepys\u2019s answer  is printed in several editions of Evelyn's Diary and Correspondence \u2018from \n                     a MS.

The cases  appear to be  of early nineteenth century \n                                  workmanshipt. \n\n                                  Provenance:   Alfred Morrison  sale (IV, 1919, Lot 2757)tt. \n\n                              Tue  news-letter was made possible in the seventeenth century by the establishment \n                              of a regular postal service both within England and to the continent. But news-letters \n                              would probably not then have flourished had it not been for the control of the press \n                              which the partisanship of the newspapers appeared  to make  necessary. For  a fee, \n                              usually five pounds per annum, a subscriber to a news-letter received a semi-weekly \n                              letter which told so much of the news of court and town or of foreign intelligence as \n                              was not in the newspapers of the time. Sometimes, it is possible that the news sent was \n                              edited or colored to suit the views of the subscriber (see Lady Newdigate Newdegate \n                              Cavalier and Puritan 1901, pp.vii-xvii) but it is unlikely that there was much of that, \n                              if only because of the difficulty of composition. Probably what most subscribers received \n\n                                     +The  only comparable series of which we can find record are the Henry Muddiman news-letters, 1667-1689, \n                                        the property of the Marquess of Bath, and the Williamson news-letters, 1667-1691, calendared in Hist. \n\n                                        MSS.

A rough \n                                        count of these last gives slightly over a thousand letters. \n\n                                       The  contents, provenance and present location of cases I-VI and X are not known. \n                                       ttAlfred Morrison privately reprinted about one fifth of these letters, from 25 October 1667 to 10 December \n\n                                         1675, in a volume entitled \u2018Bulstrode Papers, Vol. I, 1897\u2019.

MS. 103\u00a2 \n\n                                  From  the unpublished Bulstrode Papers\n\n\n\nwas merely  a clerk\u2019s copy of a master letter which was preserved by the letter-office in \n               case any question  should arise as to the news dispersed. \n                 One  of the largest of the news-letter offices of the Restoration was that organized \n               by Sir Joseph  Williamson, Secretary of State, with the assistance of Robert Yard and \n               others\u00a7. Williamson\u2019s office had a large list of subscribers and a constant effort was \n               made  to enlarge that list, not, however, solely that the profit would be the greater, for \n               the clerks received the main financial benefit from their activity. Their master, Secre- \n               tary Williamson,  employed   his office of Secretary of State and master of the letter- \n               office, i.e. post-office, to organize a large correspondence, patticularly with persons \n               residing abroad, in order to provide material for the London Gazette of which he was \n               also the publisher, as well as to keep himself informed for official reasons. The sub- \n               scribers merely received the news-letters for which they paid but to the correspondents \n               were sent, at least once a week and sometimes  more often, not only the latest London \n               Gazette but also a news-letter giving court and London news not printed in the semi- \n               weekly  Gazette. In return, the correspondents were expected to send printed newspapers \n               of the countries where they lived as well as such unprinted news as had come to their \n               ears. Williamson  was able to do this at no great expense, other than for clerical help, \n               because, through  his secretaryship, he had a franking privilege which covered letters \n               both ways. \n                  Williamson\u2019s news-letters are written on quarto paper and, for the most part, with \n               the heading  \u2018Whitehall\u2019. When the court was absent  from Westminster his letters are \n               sometimes  headed  \u2018Windsor\u2019 or \u2018Newmarket\u2019.  Apparently he also supplied, when Par- \n               liament was  in session, a daily letter covering the debates in both Houses. These parlia- \n               mentary  letters are usually, but not always, on foolscap. His clerks employed several \n\n  \n\n               different sealsta, mostly armorial. \n                 Another  news-letter office was conducted by Edward  Coleman.  He is not known, \n               apparently, to those who  have written on the news-letters of this period. However, \n               Coleman  was  not only a very accomplished news agent who  wrote detailed letters in \n               the manner of Henry  Muddiman   but he was also the same Edward Coleman, secretary \n               to the Duchess of York, who  was caught (see State Papers Dom., Charles II 1678) the \n               28 September  1678, i.e. two days after his latest letter here preserved, transmitting \n               money  to plotters against the life of Charles II and executed for treason 3rd December. \n               The evidence by  which this letter-writer may be identified with the traitor occurs in a \n\n                   \u00a7Yard became   Under-Secretary of State in 1699. Among the others may be mentioned James  Vernon who \n                     took Yard\u2019s place in charge of the London Gazette and the news-letter office, from June 1687 to April 1688, \n                     when  Yard  went to Portugal as secretary to the Duke of Grafton; Henry Ball who evidently for years, \n                     1673-1683 at least, was a trusted clerk and whose name is signed to several letters; O.Wynne, J.Tucker, \n                     and Jo.Wendon,   not otherwise known,  but who signed at least one each; and William Bridgeman, who \n                     was made  Under-Secretary in 1682 and who signed a letter in 1683.

Certainly, from 1674 on, all the \n                           letters in this collection were intended for him though few are so addressed. From \n                           9 April 1675 to 26 September 1678 there are 235 letters written from Edward Coleman\u2019s \n                           office to Bulstrode. From 24 April 1676 to 11 March 1677, concurrently with the Cole- \n\n                                  taColeman  had been in trouble in 1676, in connection with the same scandal concerning unauthorized pub- \n                                    lication of Privy Council business for which Muddiman   was  also examined,  see J.G.Muddiman    The \n                                    King\u2019s Journalist pp.205-7. Samuel Pepys  had  come  upon  a statement  in a coffee-house newsletter \n                                    announcing  the resolution of the Council to set out an expedition against the Algiers pirates. He com- \n                                    plained to the King who instructed Secretary Williamson to look into the matter. Apparently Williamson \n                                    was aware that his own assistant, Robert Yard, had sent out the same information in the news-letters he \n                                    issued from the letter-office at Whitehall, Indeed, Yard's news-letter to Bulstrode of October 1676 gives \n                                    the passage verbatim as quoted, State-Papers Domestic 7676-7 p.353, from a news-letter said to be \u2018in the \n                                    hand of Coleman, an attorney in Chancery Lane\u2019. Nevertheless, Williamson sought  to put the blame on \n                                    his rival letter-writers, especially Muddiman and Coleman. He had them examined by the Privy Council \n                                    but finally had to acknowledge that his own servant, Yard, was the real offender and that he should be \n                                    Punished (op. cit. 13 October 1676, p.368). However, Williamson did not want to let the matter end thus \n                                    for he believed that Coleman, at least, had written the same news, as indeed he had in his letter to Bul- \n                                    strode of 2 October 1676, though less circumstantially than Yard. A warrant was therefore issued 17th \n                                    October \u2018to search for and take into custody\u2014\u2014Coleman    and  bring him  to answer  what  is objected \n                                    against him concerning the dispersing of false news-letters and other dangerous practices\u2019. Coleman in \n                                    his letter to Bulstrode of 20 October 1676, under that date says: \u2018we haue had two counsells this day at \n                                    whitehall, at y* first there was a letter produc\u2019d which was found at a Coffee house, in w\u00b0 it was writ for \n                                    news, y' y\u00ae King had resolu\u2019d to sett out a fleet and y* y\u00ae D: of Monmouth was to goe as a priuate capt: \n                                    which it seemes is either not formally resolu\u2019d upon, or else, not fit to be imparted to Coffee houses, upon \n\n  \n\n                                    which y* General Intelligencers were call'd upon, to find whose it was but I cannot heare that the authour \n                                    is discouer'd\u2019, \n\n                                         Evidently  this did not end the matter, \n\n                                                                           at least in the minds of gossips, for in a letter from Coleman's \n                                    office of 29 December 1676, there is a note \u2018My Mf went out of Towne on Wednesday   last [27th] & will \n                                    not return till ye middle of y* next month\u2019. Another, 15 January 1677, reads: \u2018My M\u00b0 is just come home \n                                    from his journey\u2019; while on the 19th: \u2018Mr. Colman, of whom there has been several discourses of late, as \n                                    if he were fled, he having been 15 or 16 days out of towne about his owne occasions, is said to be returned \n                                    againe to his owne houses and appears as formerly without any great sense of feare or guilt\u2019. During the \n                                    carly part of 1678 there are numerous references to Coleman\u2019sill health, but, of course, none to his plotting. \n\n                                     [ 1242 ]\n\ntteBulstrode was,  from the evidence of a note by Robert Yard, 31 August 1685, in England at this time, \n                 Doubtless, many   of the gaps represent holidays and other interruptions. \n               \u00a7oln a letter of Secretary Jenkins to the Earl of Conway (State Papers Dom. 1682, p.113) occurs this ambigu- \n                 ous encomium:   \u2018I have nothing to trouble you with to-night but Sir Richard Bulstrode\u2019s letter, which 1 \n\n                 enclose, .. , though I know you never miss Sir Richard\u2019s letter\u2019. \n\n           VOL.IIL                           [ 1243 ]\n\nalteration wee had been forced to make [i.e. on account of information in Bulstrode\u2019s \n                               letters] wherin I don\u2019t excuse him (for it is very Idly done) but onley to give you \n                               notice of the failure ...\u2019.

There are also frequent requests that \n                               these letters should be considered as private information, e.g. 7 September 1688, Yard \n                               wrote: \u2018I againe Entreat you not to lett these papers goe out of y\" owne hands, but \n                               when you have  read them to committ them  to y\u00ae fire\u2019. \n                                 When  visiting England in August 1685, Bulstrode requested Yard  that the news- \n                               letters sent to Brussels should be written in French, presumably to save Bulstrode the \n                               trouble of translating them himself before turning them over to some  other party, \n                               possibly a Brussels \u2018intelligencer\u2019. Evidently Bulstrode\u2019s own letters were of sufficient \n                               usefulness to the London Gazette that even such drudgery as'this request entailed was \n                               not too much to be endured for Yard thereafter supplied very nearly all the letters in \n                               French. He did, however, have some qualms  for, 25 September  1685, Yard wrote: \u2018I \n                               have collected all the news I possibly can, and have putt it in the Language you desire, \n                               but one thing I pray, that you will not send my paper to anybody, for my hand may \n                               be knowne, and that you will never name me...  \u2019. \n                                 It has been saidfd: \u2018To all intents and purposes, there are no State Papers for the \n                               reign of James II.

Would you know y\u00ae reason \n                           of it.\u2019tis this, they gained their points & carryed it on with soe much craft, fraud, & \n                           cruelty, when any  thing stood in y* way  of their ambition, yt, whoever hath any \n                           goodnesse in him, as God be praysed I haue some, must needs abhorre their methods & \n                           rather dye then imitate them. \n                             I thinke mazarine was y\u00ae better of y\u00a2 two, yet y\u00ae best bad enough, for now yt they \n                           are gone of y\u00ae stage, we may speake freely of them as others doe & will of me, & perhaps \n                           of you too, whiles we are yet aliue. But speake as they list, let us liue as we ought, & all \n                           is well. their words hurt us noe more then mine can either of their dead eminencyes. \n                           I preiudge them not as to their state after death for who am I, yt I should dare attempt \n                           it! But speake it from my soule, yt were I a Papist w\u2018h I shall neuer be, as I firmely \n                           beleiue, I had rather be a poor monke in my cell, bidding of my beads, then a glorious \n                           Cardinall, at y\u00ae head of a bloody army. \n                             Perhaps you  will thinke y* in this censure my pusillanimity hath gassed & corrupted \n                           my  reason: be it soe. may I be alwayes cowardly to any thing y* is wicked & magnani- \n                           mous  only in doeing of my duty. But yt wh  swayes most with me  in this case (next \n                           to y\u00ae equity of it) is yt they are both dead as I ina little tyme shall be & yt death dogs \n                           greatnesse at y* heeles as well as littlenesse, death quae sola fatetur quaritula sunt \n                           hominum   corpuscula, yea euen those of Cardinals. Death, wh marcheth on with other \n                           grosse pompe & state, then either of them euer gloryed in carrying such a flagge as \n                           Saladine had at his funerall. So are all men living, & let them know yt all is uanity of \n                           uanityes & uexation of spirit. To be sure they find them, or, when they are putting of \n                           their gloryes & descending to another theatre. \n                             But  I am at mine old preaching ueine though silenct, & too tedious on it: for to what \n                           end doe I trouble you, who are in your prime & gayety, with such uncouth meditations, \n                           sowred by old age, & those infirmityes, w*h are y\u00ae usuall attendants of it. I confesse it \n                           is somewhat unsuiteable, but as it giues me some ease to uent my thoughts, soe it can \n                           be noe hurt to you to heare them. \n\n                                      [ 1260 ]\n\nYea may  doe  you some  good, by tempering & allaying those feruours of spirit weh \n              ouer power others of your age &  fortune, though I could neuer see y\u2018 they had such \n              effects on you.

Archbishop Laud  suspected \n                                       that he had puritanical leanings and arranged to have him spied upon. The spies evidently \n                                       made life for Hall quite unendurable.
