However, before their stints were com- \n                                pleted it was realized that the copy could not be contained in the 92 leaves of their \n                                original computation. The compositor of the last section was not inconvenienced for \n                                he could continue indefinitely with both signatures and pagination but the compositors \n                                of the first two parts had to provide larger quires at the end in order to synchronize \n                                their sections with their alphabets. It will be observed that, although they made an \n                                error as to the amount of letterpress their sections would occupy, their division of the \n                                copy was fairly accurate for each section now occupies 110 leaves counting  blanks. \n                                From  the ornaments it would appear that the first section was printed by Griffin; the \n                                second cannot be identified since there are no ornaments; the third, including the index, \n                                was printed by Ruth Raworth or her husband  Thomas  Newcombe. \n                                  According to Dibdin (Library Companion  1825, p.526)  Lord  Spencer  possessed a \n                                Jarge-paper copy of the \u2018first folio\u2019 edition of this book.

The Bindley large-paper copy of that edition (IV, 1820, Lot 847) was \n                                mee    by Triphook, the dealer from whom  Dibdin  said Lord  Spencer  acquired the \n                                 ook. \n                                  According to Sir Sidney Lee, the third Earl of Cherbury sued Whitaker in the House \n                               of Lords regarding this book. Whatever the outcome of the litigation may have  been, \n                                this title was not transferred after Whitaker's death along with his other copyrights. \n\n                                         tA British Museum  copy has before Sig \n                                           with the frontispiece, That leaf con \n                                           Eighth\u2019 signed \u20187[ames}.

(Both states reproduced, \n                                 Grolier Club W-P M1, p.78.) Since the undated state reads more nearly as does the title \n                               of  the second edition [q..], as was first pointed out by L.S.Livingston in the Bidliophile \n                                 (N.Y.Evening  Post, 29th June 1907), it is possible that it is the later state. However, \n                                 it is equally possible that the variants have no particular temporal relation and that \n                                 the undated state (with Green\u2019s name) occurs in that portion of the edition intended \n                                 for sale at Cambridge and that the dated state was for distribution through the trade \n                                 generally. \n                                 _ Because the Huth-Clark  and the Hoe-Huntington   copies of the undated   state are \n                                 in fine morocco bindings of the period it has been suggested that that state was pre- \n                                 pared for presentation. The addition in that state of the identifying clause concerning \n                                 the author and the name of the bookseller from whom copies might  be  bought  would \n                                 seem to indicate that, if the above mentioned copies were actually presentation ones, \n                                 the fact that they are of the rarer issue was purely accidental. \n                                   When   \u201cbrother Ferrar\u2019 sought a licence for this \u2018little book\u2019 the Vice Chancellor \n                                 objected to two lines, now well known, in the \u2018Church Militant\u2019: \n                                                      Religion stands on tiptoe in our land, \n                                                      Ready  to pass to the American strand. \n\n                                Eg, the Bodleian, the Baynes-Brand-Heber-Daniel-Lewi \n                                             i        -Brand-Heber- Daniel-Lewis-Foote-Hoe-Huntington, idgewater-Hunt- \n                                 ington, and the Huth-C.W.Clark copies.       eter          eae \n\n{ 468 ]\n\nFinally he passed them, saying: \u2018I knew  Mr. Herbert well, and know  that he was a \n           divine poet; but  I hope the world will not take him to be an inspired prophet, and \n           therefore I license the whole book.\u2019. \n              The title \u2018The Temple\u2019 was supplied by Ferrar. \n\n            S.T.C,  13183.

The division of the book between \n                                            \u2018two compositors, at the end of sheet Q, as indicated by the signatures of the fourth leaf of each sheet \n                                            (except Sig W and Aa), as well as the general neatness of the typography, make it appear unlikely that \n                                            Copland was the printer for at that time he was too poor to have had two presses and besides was always \n                                            a careless workman, However, the title-compartment was his, and initials which he was using both before \n                                            and after this book appeared occur recto B, recto B2, verso Ny, and recto Aag. But the initials on recto \n                                            \u201882 and recto Bb appear in books printed at this time by Tottel. The initials on recto B3 and recto Fa, at \n                                            \u2018one time Berthelet's, and that on recto Dd, at one time Caly\u2019s, though they are not in any of Tottel\u2019s \n                                            books which we have examined, may  have come to Tottel along with other material which  can be traced \n                                            to his shop from those sources. The initial on recto W3, formerly Day's, was used by Wayland  shortly \n                                            before this book appeared but it also may have passed along with other recorded stock to Tottel as W: \n                                            and  apparently retired about this time from active printing. Several of the other initials are very similar \n                                            to ones which are known to have been used by Tottel and as, in a number of other instances, he had more \n\n  \n\n                                           =   one cag    of the same design these may likewise have been his though we cannot trace them in \n                                           is work, \n\n                                           gate       \u00ab= e     ts  is one of which several printers, including Copland and Tottel, had supplies. \n                                           Wee                  a    the period of this book a more worn and dirty look than in this volume. \n                                           contac     tutes aa    oe        we have seen of Copland\u2019s books, there is a much larger number of \n                                           edition of King tthe which foe       at      ths book  In 1557, Copland  finally brought forth his \n                                           some ne   Ae     iter  which from various typographical indications, had apparently occupied him for \n                                                     A general comparison of Tortel\u2019s work with the present volume leads one to believe that it was \n\n                                             neat iar   % have been produced in his shop than in Copland\u2019s but, in any case, no satisfactory explana \n                                                      we diversity of sources of the blocks used can at present be found. \n\n                                     [470 ]\n\nblank,  recto  [N4];  The  Argumente    of the \n            fourthe  Booke, verso; text, recto fol.46-85, 85- \n            verso  fol.[87]; The Argumente   of the eyghte \n             Booke, recto Aa4; verso blank; text, recto fol. \n\n                                                             The  Annotations  in forme of a Table,  recto \n                                                             Ddz-recto  [Hha]; colophon,  recto [Hha]; er- \n                                                             rata, verso.

In order to conceal the  age and  original \n                                publication of this tract the title as well as the signatures of the commendatory verses \n                                were changed. A  passage concerning Alleyn was inserted by Cartwright, p.29. \n                                   \u2018The date of publication of this edition, which was brought forth doubtless by the \n                                agitation regarding the re-opening of the play-houses, can be established with some \n                                certainty as during the first half of 1658 by reason of the fact that the Thomason copy \n                                in the British Museum  is dated rsth June 1658. \n                                   \u2018The \u2018W.C.\u2019 of the imprint and dedication was William Cartwright, the actor, for in \n                                 the dedication he speaks of the profession of the stage as being a common \u2018Quality\u2019 of \n                                 both Heywood  and himself. From the imprint, it would seem that Cartwright  caused \n                                 this edition to be privately printed. He is not otherwise known as a publisher. \n\n                                      Haart   I, 487.   Cuark   Proc. Oxom. Bibl.

It was designed to \n             attract that growing public which, worried and confused by the shadow of the coming \n             troubles, might hope  for guidance from this farrago of prognostications in much the \n             same way  that the public seizes upon each new economic forecast of today. Heywood, \n             however, was a credulous man  and it is not possible to determine how much of this he \n             wrote with  his tongue in his cheek. In any case, this appears to have been the fore- \n\n            runner of a flood of \u2018Prophesies\u2019. \n               The present would  appear to have  been printed in an unusually large edition for \n            it is among the commonest   of Heywood\u2019s  works.
