The hand is not Lambarde\u2019s but \n      \u2018Tate\u2019s; Lambarde is not therefore testifying to Joscelyn\u2019s \n      ownership  of the liber antiquus (Nero  A.I), as Ker \n      assumed;  instead, Tate is recording that that manu- \n      script had been owned first by Joscelyn and then (rather \n      more ambiguously)  by Lambarde  (whose ownership is, \n      nevertheless, confirmed  by 21.4), and  Tate is also \n      responsible for the later addition noting Cotton\u2019s acqui- \n      sition of it. In addition, the text of fols 42-80 is in his \n      hand. (This analysis is based on an  examination  of \n      \u2018Tate's Anglo-Saxon, secretary and italic hands of which \n      Faust. EV, fols 107-8, provide good examples; and on \n      the style of Lambarde\u2019s undoubted signature, for which \n      see Jul. C.V, fol. 25v, and Harl. MS 6996, fol. 122. I owe",

        "text": "The   modern  arrangement,  largely set out in Planta\u2019s \n     Catalogue, divides Aug. I into two parts, 1.i consisting \n     of 86 numbered items and L.ii having 117 items (both as \n     in Planta), together with a Supplement of 21 items (not \n     listed by Planta). However, Smith\u2019s brief Catalogue \n     entry for Aug. I, which he described  as a \u2018volumen \n     vegrandis molis\u2019,, makes no such division and specifies \n     only seven items, although it is clear that at least three \n     are descriptions of multiple items. According to the \n     Report of 1703, the \u2018codex\u2019 then contained 105 folios \n     and an  index. There is a numbering  on some  items \n     which  post-dates Smith's  Catalogue and  pre-dates \n     Planta\u2019s (e.g., Aug. Lii.22 (\u2018[AJugustus. 1-116\u2019), 23 \n     (\u2018Augustus. I. 115\u00b0), 25 (Augustus I. 119\u2019), 26 (Augustus \n     ~ 1-120\u2019) and 28 (\u2018Augustus: I. 117\u2019)), and this series was \n     apparently in existence before  1707 when   William \n     Watkins scrutinised (at least part of) Augustus I, noting \n     the numbering on 1.i.47 (Augustus. I. 29\u2019 and \u2018Augustus. \n     I. 30\u2019), 49 (Augustus I. 31, 32\u2019) and 55 (\u2018Augustus I. 36, \n     37, 38, 39\u2019). There are two numbers from some other \n     series on Li.13. \n  The  material in Aug. I bears little evidence of Cotton's \n     ownership  or, indeed, of previous ownership. In the \n     entries which follow, therefore, only those items are listed \n     where immediate  pre-Cottonian ownership  or a cata- \n     logue or loan record can be established. Unfortunately, \n     only in the case of one of the few surviving records \n     (43.1) of loans of maps  is the wording  sufficiently \n     specific to make it possible to establish which maps \n     were being borrowed or where they had come from: two \n     other records (2.16, 2.80) refer to a clearly important \n     book of printed maps which, sadly, has yet to be identi- \n     fied. However, one or two observations may be made on \n     the sources of Cotton's acquisitions. Janet Backhouse \n     (Sir Robert Cotton's record of a royal bookshelf\u2019, in \n     Wright, Cotton as Collector, pp. 235 and 237 n. 24) has \n     noted that the 1547 inventory of King  Henry  VIII's \n     goods and chattels records that in \u2018the litel Study called \n     the newe  Librarye\u2019 there were  \u2018uppon two  Shelues \n     paternes for Castles and engynnes of warre\u2019 (Harl. MS \n     1419A, fol. 187), and comments that there are drawings \n     and designs of this type in Augustus. It is therefore \n     possible that Cotton obtained some of his maps  and \n     charts from the Royal collections. In addition, in their \n     discussion of the interaction between the collection of \n     maps  at Hatfield House and the acquisitions of other \n     collectors, Skelton & Summerson  observed (Maps  at \n     Hatfield House, pp. 10, 16, 20) that many of the items \n     in Augustus I must once have belonged to William Cecil \n     or to his son, Robert, or both. Again, precision is diffi- \n     cult to achieve but timing may be less so. The death of \n     Robert Cecil in 1612 provided Thomas Wilson, Keeper \n     of State Papers, with a major opportunity to repossess \n     papers which had been lost in previous decades (Skelton \n     & Summerson,   p. 15) and it is more than likely that \n     Cotton, too, was able to benefit from this event. (I owe\n\nthis observation and much advice on the subject of the \n                 Augustus  maps to Peter Barber.) Furthermore, Skelton \n                 &  Summerson   (p. 16 and n. 8) pointed to Aug. Lii.41 \n                 (noted \u2018John Dunstall pincit. 1612\u2019) as evidence that \n                 Cotton  employed  copyists, this plan of Carrickfergus \n                 having been  taken from a now  lost original drawn in \n                 about 1567. But while the date may be significant, no \n                 firm proof of such a practice has yet emerged, although \n                 the possibility may well gain credence from Cotton's \n                 habit of  commissioning  transcripts of state paper \n                 material.",

Neither makes any \n      reference to the many   charters and other material \n      which  now fall outside the Emperor system, though of \n      these the charters had been previously catalogued, in \n      hand-written form, by Smith in accordance with their \n      arrangement  in boxes (then, in fact, assigned to every \n      Emperor  apart from Vespasian, Titus and Domitian). \n      His catalogue is now Bodl., MS Smith 90 (SC 15695), of \n      which Add. MS  38683 is a transcript. At the time of the \n      Report of 1703, Humfrey  Wanley listed a great deal of \n      material - charters, bulls, seals, etc. - chiefly under \n      Emperor   headings (except for Domitian), with  that \n      under Augustus  shown as housed in 18 boxes (capsae), \n      while his catalogue in Harl. MS 7647 is an almost exact \n      copy of his listing in the Report. Smith\u2019s numbering sur- \n      vives on many of the Augustus charters, while a further \n       numbering - for example in Roman  numerals on Aug. \n       11.122 (\u2018XVII\u2019) and 11.123 (\u2018XVIII\u2019), perhaps a reference \n      to the capsae \u2014 is evident occasionally. In 1718 David \n       Wilkins appears to have been engaged in some sort of \n       scrutiny of the charters: his note on Aug. II.108 states \n       that he had found \u2018tract\u2019 no. 102 (now 107) missing. A \n       more detailed analysis of this, and other, information is \n       outside the scope of the present work but it seems likely \n       that a fuller investigation of the arrangement   of \n       Cottonian charters in the seventeenth century should in \n       due course bear fruit. \n     None  of the Augustus charters carries either Cotton's \n       signature or his annotations, and there is little evidence \n       of loans of these items in the seventeenth century. \n       The  entries below  are limited to those  Augustus \n       charters where catalogue or  loans records exist, or \n       where  immediate  pre-Cottonian provenance  can be \n       established. \n     Richard James  and Roger Dodsworth  made  substantial \n       extracts from the Augustus charters. For those taken \n       from the pre-Conquest charters see P.H. Sawyer, Anglo- \n       Saxon  Charters. An annotated list and bibliography, \n       Royal Historical Society (London, 1968).",

However,  in spite of \n                Joscelyn\u2019s ownership of the earlier parts of the manu- \n                 script it cannot have been bound as one when it reached \n                 Cotton because the latter\u2019s signature is on fol. 91, the \n                first leaf of art. 4.

I owe the latter reference to Ruth Wright. Purchas \n      also states that Raleigh had an English translation \n      done. An alternative provenance has, however, been \n      advanced by Timothy Graham  who argues convincingly \n      that the  manuscript  was  probably  secured  from \n      Edmund  Hakluyt who was persuaded by William L'sle \n      to present it to Cotton rather than to Trinity College, \n      Cambridge. See T. Graham, \u2018L'Isle\u2019s letters to Cotton\u2019, \n      pp. 367-68  (printing Harl. MS  7000,  fol. 92). In \n      exchange for securing it, Cotton was expected to pro- \n      vide a manuscript of Grosseteste. Graham suggests that \n      the Grosseteste manuscript may be Cambridge, Trinity \n      College, MS B.15.20, but, as he points out, there is no \n      evidence of Cottonian ownership in it. It had earlier \n      belonged to contemporaries of Cotton - Henry Howard, \n      earl of Northampton, John Dee  and Henry  Savile of \n      Banke (not necessarily in that order) - and was listed \n      as a Trinity manuscript in CMA.

John Laughton, ? c.1634 (137.2). \n          Lord  William Howard   wrote to Cotton in 1621 (Vesp. \n            F.XIII, no. 318) asking to borrow his manuscript of \n            Johannes Anglicus; the implication of the letter is that \n            neither he nor  Roscarrock had  previously seen the \n            manuscript. The only mention of Johannes Anglicus in \n            the catalogue entries listed above is in 6018, no. 201, \n            where  his authorship is noted as an addition to the \n            entry. This (unhappily slender) piece of evidence may \n            therefore suggest that the manuscript borrowed in loan \n            20.1 (\u2018Capgrave Legenda Angliae  Foll.) was no. 208. \n            The situation is, however, complicated by the fact that \n            Roscarrock,  like Cotton,  thought  that the  Nova \n            Legenda  Anglie, the borrowing at 20.1, was written by \n            Capgrave and  supposed that Johannes Anglicus (now \n            known  to have been John of Tynemouth, the real author \n            of the Nova Legenda) was  the same man.  (I owe this \n            information  about Roscarrock  to  Nicholas Orme.) \n            Additional evidence is offered by Oxford, Jesus College \n            MS  77, fols 63-64v, which contains information col- \n            lected by Augustine Baker, 1637, concerning Tib. E.1. \n            Baker  refers to a note then recently written in the \n            manuscript which gave its author as Johannes Anglicus: \n            see Carley, \u2018Royal library\u2019, p. 225 n. 23. (It seems certain \n            that this note survives as fol. 1 of the manuscript. Fol. 1 \n            is very badly damaged  but sufficient of its text can \n            be read under  ultra-violet light to establish that it \n            contained some sort of comparison of Capgrave's text \n            with another: for example, one phrase reads \u2018... hath \n            which Capgrave  hath not viz...) This evidence may \n            therefore indicate that 6018, no. 201 (where, as noted \n            above, Johannes is entered as author), is more likely to \n            refer to Tib. than to Otho, but the entry for Tib. in \n            36682  gives Capgrave rather than  Johannes  as the \n            author. \n          Simonds D\u2019Ewes  asked to borrow either this manuscript \n            or Otho D.IX, 1626 (82.28).",

(There  is, however, a heavily erased \n           marginal annotation on the relevant folio in BVI.) \n         He also used fols 104-202, artt. 4-14, of this (and Claud. \n           B.D), listed (Chartular[y]. . . ofthe. Abbey of Abingdon\u2019) \n           as a Cotton manuscript, in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. \n           His extracts on p. 208 make it clear that he consulted \n           both manuscripts (they are taken from fol. 107v in C.IX \n           and fol. 12v in B.VI) but his preference seems to have \n           been to use C.IX: e.g. the (identical) originals of his \n           extracts on pp. 298-99 are underlined  in the former \n           (fol. 141v) but not in the latter (fols 128-28v) as are \n           those on p. 53 (found in C.IX, fol. 116v, and B.VI, fol. \n           49), while the \u2018Marginal note in an ancient hand\u2019 (also \n           on p. 53) is present in C.IX, fol. 116y, but not in B.VI. \n         There are  extracts by Richard James  from  either this \n           manuscript  or Claud.

C.III, fol. 155). \n    Fols 98-321, art. 7 of this or Nero D.I used by Selden and \n      listed (\u2018Matthew Paris his liues of the Abbots  of S \n      Albons\u2019) as a Cotton  manuscript  in his Historie of \n      Tithes, 1618. Selden\u2019s extract (on p. 329) is from fol. \n      105v of part I of E.IV and from fol. 35 of D.1. In view of \n      the pencil trefoil markings (of a type used by Cotton) \n      against the passage in D.I, it is likely that that manu- \n      script rather than E.IV was Selden\u2019s source. \n    Richard  James\u2019s excerpts from this manuscript  are in \n      Bodl., MS James 10 (SC 3847), p. 102. \n    \u2018The number \u2018261\u2019 at the top of fol. 33 (above the second \n      version of the contents-table) is not that for this manu- \n      script in 6018 but for Galba A-XV. \n    It would  seem, from  the composition  of the  present \n      volume, that Cotton added to it (as shown, for example, \n      by a comparison of the two contents-tables, on fols 1v \n      and 33, of which the former, which is undoubtedly the \n      later of the two, includes art. 1, while the latter, by \n      Richard James, does not).

The conflict between the date of this \n           loan and  that of Bowyer\u2019s ownership  has yet to be \n           resolved: it is possible that  the manuscript   was \n           temporarily in Cotton's hands in 1608. \n         The Murimuth   chronicle in this manuscript is that listed \n           by John Joscelyn in Nero C.III, fol. 211v, as owned by \n           \u201cMr Boyer\u2019, a record subsequently annotated \u2018R. Cotton\u2019 \n           by  Cotton  himself  (see also Graham   &   Watson, \n           Recovery of the Past, p. 43 n. 112, and J.2.105); and \n           although Joscelyn does not mention the previous article, \n           the Flores Historiarum, entry 13.15 makes it clear that \n           it must also have belonged to Robert Bowyer. In any \n           case, despite a separate sixteenth-century foliation for \n           the Murimuth,   the manuscript  is a unity. Joscelyn\u2019s \n           entry also listed another chronicle running from 1320 \n           to 1380, now Oxford, Queen's College, MS 304 (Graham \n           & Watson, J2.105). The annotations on fol. 144 and the \n           following leaves could well be  by William  Bowyer, \n           Robert's father; the marginal mark on fol. 246 of three \n           dots surmounting   a comma   is one-used  by Robert \n           (Proceedings in Parliament 1610, ed. by E.R. Foster, 2 \n           vols (New Haven  and London,  1966), I, p. xxii). If this \n           manuscript  was owned  by both of the Bowyers, father \n           and  son, it is unlikely also to have belonged to Savile \n           and  indeed Watson appears to have discarded Savile\u2019s \n           possible ownership in Graham & Watson, J2.105. There \n           are annotations by Joscelyn on fols 200, 200v. \n         According to Hardy, Descriptive Catalogue, 111, 313, the \n           manuscript  was used by John Stow.",

Galba A.VI was missing when the checklist of \n         1656/7 was drawn up (\u2018A.6. Liber Antiquus Hymnorum; \n         etc. not there: but in the place, Fragments of a booke of \n         Alfred, in Saxon: very ancient: in two parcels; noted, \n         A.B-), and still missing when both Smith and Planta \n         compiled their catalogues. Smith stated that the manu- \n         script had been moved to another (unspecified) location \n         in the library and Planta suggested its identity with Calig. \n         A.XIV. The  probability is therefore that Calig.

Both Smith  and Planta in their catalogues list \n                it as missing (respectively \u2018Deest\u2019, \u2018Desideratur\u2019). In \n                36682  it is entered as \u2018Inter Angliam & Belgiam\u2019, but \n                without  the date which   is given for neighbouring \n                entries, and in the checklist of 1656/7 (36682, fol. 1v) it \n                is noted as \u2018wanting\u2019. On the other hand, in one of the \n                later seventeenth-century catalogues, London, Inner \n                Temple  Library, MS  Petyt 538/41, it is entered as \u20181 \n                Inter Belgiam et Angliam\u2019 with \u2018D.6\u2019 in the margin. In \n                contrast with other entries, there is no other volume \n                number   or dating in this entry but those before and \n                after it, for \u2018D.5\u2019 and \u2018D.7,, read as follows: \u20181 Inter \n                Angliam  et Belgiam  Anno  1589  a Julio ad Dec  28 \n                volumen,   and  \u20181 Fasciculus  transmissorum   inter \n                Angliam  et Belgiam Anno  1590. 30 volumen\u2019, a num- \n                bering which  imples no. \u201829\u2019 for D.VI. However, this \n                numbering  is contradicted by entries in the contents- \n                tables which have been written into many of the Galba \n                state paper volumes. In these, Galba D.IV is noted as \n                the 27th volume and  Galba D.VII as the 29th volume. \n                On  this basis, Galba D.V (which has no contents-table \n                now)  must have been the 28th volume, which leaves no \n                room  in this sequence for D.VI. Furthermore, in another \n                of the later catalogues, Bodl., MS Rawlinson D.901 (SC \n                13667), which  post-dates Petyt 538/41, DVI is again \n                marked  \u2018Deest\u2019. Taken together, therefore, this evidence \n                raises doubts  without  offering obvious  solutions. \n                Moreover,  in an attempt  to explain D.VI\u2019s absence, \n                Wormald   & Wright suggested some years ago (English \n                Library, p. 203) that it had been lent to Robert Cecil \n                (d. 1612) and never returned. But this, too, presents \n                difficulties. The manuscript that Cecil borrowed (see \n                list 85.2) concerned the years 1586-87 and is therefore \n                more  likely to have been Galba C.X than D.VI which, \n                provided it was correctly placed in the sequence, must \n                have covered the years 1589-90 (although it should also \n               be observed that this is a period which is well served by \n               Galba  DV and VII with no glaring gaps in date between \n                them). On  the other hand - in further support of the \n                existence of  DVI  - by the time  of  the  loans to \n                Whitelocke in 1651/2 (see above), the Galba state paper \n                volumes  were clearly fully bound up and the numbers \n                of manuscripts  recorded as lent to him require the \n                inclusion of D.VI. Moreover, D.VI is most likely the \n                manuscript  separately listed at 231.33 and it may not\n\nENTRIES",

In that case, either fols 35-94 went to Cotton at \n           the same time as fol. 34 and the remainder of Otho A.I, \n           whereupon  fol. 34 was detached from A.I (perhaps in \n           the course of its rearrangement that the catalogues \n           reveal - see below) and added to fols 35-94, or fol. 34 \n           never went to Cotton but was joined with fols 35-94 in \n           Allen\u2019s hands. There are supporting  arguments  for \n           either possibility as both men were in the habit of re- \n           arranging manuscripts and James Ussher, a post-Allen \n           owner of fols 35-94, received other Wycliffite material \n           from Cotton. However,  the probability is that Cotton \n           never received these folios with A.I from Allen, for they \n           are listed in Allen\u2019s 1622 catalogue while Otho A.I is \n           not. Moreover, we know that Cotton had been hoping \n           to acquire A.1 from Allen in the previous year (see 3.12). \n         Loan: William Watts, 1640 (206.1). \n         The order of items set out in 36789 and 36682  differs \n           from that in Smith, Catalogue. Keynes, \u2018Cotton MS. Otho \n           A.D, 122-23, has therefore pointed out that it would \n           appear that the  Regula pastoralis was moved  from \n           second place in the manuscript in the 1620s to the end \n           by the time of Smith\u2019s Catalogue entry. If this transfer \n           did indeed take place in the 1620s (as is most likely), \n           the entries in 36789 and 36682 must have been copied \n           from an unaltered contents-table (no longer surviving \n           in the manuscript)  rather than  from  the (altered) \n           manuscript.",

In 36682 the \n                 entry for C.II is of another manuscript, \u2018Registrum \n                 Monasterii Sancti Petri Westmonasterii. There  is no \n                 entry for C.II (or C.IID) in Smith\u2019s Catalogue, both being \n                 recorded as missing (\u2018Desunt\u2019), but in Smith\u2019s annota- \n                 tions to his working copy of his Catalogue he notes C.1I \n                 as restored and lists its contents (\u2018Flores Historiarum\u2019,, \n                 etc.) on a flyleaf (Bodl., MS Smith 140 (SC 15738, p. 3). \n                 Later, in the inventory of 1718 (Add. MS  4696), the \n                 \u2018Registrum\u2019 reappears but  in David Casley\u2019s annota- \n                 tions, made to Smith\u2019s Catalogue after the Fire, C.II is \n                 described  as the  Flores historiarum  (see Frederic \n                 Madden's annotations to the Fire Report). This confusion \n                 may owe  something to the fact that, according to Smith, \n                 the Flores historiarum formerly belonged to St Peter's, \n                 Westminster  (MS  Smith  140, p. 1; and  see below). \n                 However, it may also be that a Westminster register was \n                 once shelved next to the Flores historiarum, becoming \n                 confused with  C.II and therefore accounting for the \n                 apparent absence of a manuscript under Otho C.III. It \n                 may  also be  relevant that in 1696/7 Smith  was  in \n                 correspondence with Robert Peacock, one of the execu- \n                 tors of Richard Perrincheif (d. 1673), prebendary of \n                 Westminster.  Perrincheif had borrowed  manuscripts \n                 relating to Westminster from the Cotton library, which \n                 Smith was  endeavouring to recover: Bodl., MSS Smith \n                 53 (SC 15660), p. 109, and Smith 65 (SC'15671), pp. 153, \n                 155; see also DNB (under Perrincheif}) and J. Le Neve, \n                 Fasti ecclesiae Anglicanae, ed. by T.D. Hardy, 3 vols \n                 (Oxford, 1854), IIT, p. 361. One of these manuscripts was \n                 Tit. A-VIII; it is possible that Otho C.II may have been \n                 another.

On fol. 1 of his manuscript, \n       Parker entered  the inscription, \u2018... Hic liber olim \n       missus a Gregorio pp ad augustinum archiepiscopum: \n       sed nuper sic mutilatus. An addition in Cotton\u2019s hand \n       to the 6018 entry for C.V echoes this statement of prove- \n       nance: \u2018Liber quondam Augustini Anglorwm  Apostoli! \n       This indicates that Cotton was somehow aware of the \n       tradition of St Augustine's ownership but there is no \n       evidence that he knew of the inscription in 197B or was \n       aware that it had once formed part of C.V. When Smith \n       wrote  his description of C.V in his Catalogue  he \n       remarked  upon  the story of its connection with St \n       Augustine, pointing out that while no evidence in sub- \n       stantiation then survived in the manuscript it might \n       formerly have existed on a lost leaf.

On grounds of size, this loan cannot be\n\nidentified with Cotton\u2019s other manuscript of Tewkesbury \n                 annals, Cleo. A.VII, a small quarto volume on vellum \n                 (and itself probably the manuscript lent at 2.107). The \n                 list in Otho D.I, a folio manuscript, of the founders of \n                 Tewkesbury  Abbey  was destroyed in the fire of 1731 \n                 when other parts of the manuscript were damaged. The \n                 list may have been a late insertion in Otho (it is not \n                 mentioned  in 6018 and it is perhaps the item entered, \n                 on its own, in 36789, fol. 95 (unless this is Cleo. C.III, \n                 fols 210-28, art. 12) and, with the remainder of Otho, \n                 on fol. 146); it was recorded at the end of Smith's \n                 Catalogue entry, although he says that it followed his \n                 art. 2; and it may have been written on paper (Report \n                 of 1703). It (or Cleo. C.IIT) is therefore likely to have \n                 been the \u2018litle paper book of Tewkesbury\u2019 which Cotton \n                 undoubtedly possessed and  which Augustine  Vincent \n                 (according to an undated letter: Vesp. F.XIII, no. 322) \n                 was unable to borrow as it was already out on loan. As \n                 Vincent did borrow a Tewkesbury manuscript (at 2.107, \n                 which, as already stated, is probably Cleo. A.VII) and at \n                 the same time as 2.105 was out on loan, this increases \n                 the chances that 2.105 is both the \u2018litle paper book\u2019 and \n                 the article in Otho D.I. However, there is an extract \n                 (though with minor  verbal differences), which could \n                 have  been  taken  from  Cleo.

These two \n      entries seem unlikely to refer to the same volume but in \n      one of the later catalogues, Bodl., MS Rawlinson D.901 \n      (SC 13667), p. 131, the entry repeats that in 36682 and \n      is preceded by \u2018Inter: Roman & Angliam\u2019 B.I was, how- \n     ever, recorded as missing in the checklist of 1656/7 \n      (36682, fol. 1v), a list which was probably prepared \n     before the Rawlinson catalogue. \n   Loan:  Peter Balle, 1640 (205.1: \u2018. . .concerninge Religion \n     from  Hen. 6. downward.  marked  Vitellius B.T\u2019, ? this, \n     but see below). \n   In a letter of 1697 to Sir John Cotton, Thomas Smith listed \n     as missing Vit. B.I and three others (Vit. B-XV-XVID), all \n     of which he was keen to recover and which he believed \n     related to transactions between England and Rome  in \n    the first and last years of the reign of Henry VIII: Bodl., \n     MS  Smith 59 (SC 15666), p, 265. However, as the early \n     entries in Vit. B.II date from the first months of Henry \n     VIII's reign, it seems doubtful whether Smith was correct \n    in believing that this B.1 had ever existed, although in \n    view of the terminal dates in B.XIV he may have been \n     right in stating that B.XV-XVII had been lost. Similarly, \n     despite the listing under the B.I pressmark of a probably \n     different manuscript in 36682 and the specific citation of \n     \u2018Vitellius B.I\u2019 in the loan to Balle, there must also be some \n     doubt whether that manuscript had existed. The entry in \n     36682  may in fact have been prepared for what became \n     Cleo. E.I-III: the descriptions of these three manuscripts \n     in the same catalogue and the wording  on their title- \n     pages closely echo the entry for B.I. Furthermore, the \n     loan to Balle may well refer to Cleo. E.III.",

C.VII, fols. \n      6r-va\u2019, because a fragment of Dares Phrygius is bound \n      into C.VIIL). \n    Fols 157-64 once belonged with what is now Claud. C.VI, \n      fols 1 and 205 (see note by Frederic Madden on fol. 157). \n      It is not known whether Cotton was responsible for the \n      separation. \n    Brian Twyne  made  extracts from fols 26-84, art. 5, in \n      Bodl., MS Twyne  22, p. 294. \n    Richard  James made  extracts from this manuscript  in \n      Bodl., MS James 28 (SC 3865), pp. 64-68. \n    The note, in Richard James's hand, on fol. 2 of Tit. A-XIV \n      (\u2018De quodam  Thoma   Wyke. Vide  epistolam Adam  de \n      Maresco  epistolarum eius fol. 110\u00b0) may refer to the \n      collection of letters in this manuscript, but the letter \n      relating to a Thomas Wykes is on fols 67-67v of C.VIII \n      and there is no evidence that that leaf may once have \n      been numbered   110. \n    The sequence of the first three articles in the manuscript \n      differs from that given in the catalogues of Smith and \n      Planta, and in Richard James's contents-table in the \n      manuscript  itself. However, these cataloguers must \n      have  erred because the sequence  is that set out in \n      Savile\u2019s catalogue. \n    Annexes  3b, 5a.",

Powell, Repertorie of \n           Records (London, 1631), p. 133) that fols 229-30v, art. \n           22, and fols 235-39v, art. 25, or copies of these, may \n           have been the manuscript \u2018deposited by Agarde in the \n           First Treasury at Westminster\u2019. However, Powell's work, \n           published over fifteen years after Agarde\u2019s death, reads \n           as though the latter's text was still to be found there, \n           while the Cotton folios are annotated by Sir Robert (on \n           fol. 235; heading and quire sig.). It is therefore unlikely \n           that these were Agarde\u2019s deposited originals. \n        The  letter of 1576 from John Harpsfield to Dee on fol. 56 \n           indicates that Harpsfield provided the original manu- \n           script which was one of the sources from  which Dee \n           made  his copy of Sigebertus Gemblicensis,  now  fols \n           3-57 of this manuscript.

        "text": "annotation on fol. 3 appears to be in L'lsle\u2019s hand and \n     arguing that this manuscript may  well have been the \n     source of a reference published by Lsle in 1623 in A \n     Saxon   Treatise from Book  I of the  Liber Eliensis. \n     Graham   also suggests that an erased inscription on fol. \n     95 of Dom. XV  can be read as including the letters \u2018Au\u2019 \n     and  \u2018t, probably of \u2018Augustine\u2019, Lindsell\u2019s first name. \n     However,  the difficulty with this identification is that \n      Dom. XV  must  almost certainly have been in Cotton's \n     hands  well before  1622. A  loan (71.37) to Arthur \n     Agarde,  d. 1615, reads: \u2018Item a Book of Ely in 4*\u00b0 old \n     bound  having  the lyf of St Ethelred in it it was Mr \n     Austen  steward\u2019. Dom. XV is the only Ely manuscript in \n     the Cotton collection to contain a life of St Etheldreda, \n     while the fact that Augustine Steward is recorded as its \n     previous  owner  opens  up  the  possibility that the \n     inscription on fol. 95 is associated with him rather than \n     with Lindsell. (For a more detailed investigation of this \n     last point, see the entry for Dom.) If, therefore, Dom. \n     XVis  to be ruled out as the manuscript passed to Cotton \n      in 1622 (and presumably that listed at 3.5), either Vesp. \n     A.XIX  or the manuscript listed as no. 271 of 6018 (and \n      now  missing) may  be alternatives. The entry at 3.5 \n     does not entirely describe A-XTX but could well accord \n     with no. 271 (\u2018Historia Eliensis Monasterii libri tres. . . \n      Inseruntur etiam   successive transcriptio omnium \n     cartarum  .. 2, an entry in Cotton\u2019s hand). Moreover, in \n     the margin  against no. 271 is written, also by Cotton, \n     \u2018Doctor  Lindsey\u2019. In addition, the entry for no. 271 \n      indicates that the manuscript may have included the \n      material published by Lisle in 1623, although none \n      of this analysis precludes the possibility that he also \n      consulted Dom. XV. \n   Previous ownership:  (of fols 104-21y, art. 7) ? William \n      Camden  (E. M. C. van Houts, \u2018Camden, Cotton and the \n      chronicles of the Norman  Conquest  of England\u2019, in \n      Wright, Cotton as Collector, p. 243, argues for Camden's \n      ownership  on  the grounds  that  he printed  these \n      folios in Anglica, Hibernica, Normannica, Cambrica, a \n      veteribus scripta (Frankfort, 1602), stating in the \n      subtitle to that edition that he was using manuscripts \n      from his own  library. Fols 104\u201421v are listed in the \n      Richmond   Palace  inventory of  1535:  see  Carley, \n      Libraries of Henry VUI, p. xxiii, H1.113. \n   Loans: Peter Balle, 1651 (127: this, Tib.

O'Sullivan states \n     that the manuscript consists of three items once owned \n     by Bale. \n   In Vesp. E.XII, fol. 77, reference is made in a marginal \n     annotation (allegedly by Richard James) to a \u2018Codex \n     Camdenianus\u2019  and  it has been argued that this must \n     refer to Tit. A-XX (which therefore would have belonged \n     to William Camden). The annotation is not, however, in \n     James's hand: had this been correct it would have pro- \n     duced a conflict in ownership - immediately before that \n     of Cotton ~ between Camden  and Bowyer. If Camden's \n     ownership remains a possibility, it must have preceded \n     Bowyer's and followed Bale'\u2019s. See A. G.

E.XII  is wrongly cited as Vit. E.XII). Rigg\u2019s \n     attribution to James of some (at least) of the notes in \n     A.XX  is incorrect: for example, the headings on fol. 52, \n     art. 3, fol. 69v, art. 7, and 70, art. 8, etc., are not by \n     James but are probably by Cotton, and neither of the \n     annotations (in two different hands) on fol. 98, art. 19",

The volume is not entered in \n            Smith, Catalogue, but in his own copy he added it to the \n            printed entries: Bodl, MS Smith 140 (SC 15738). In the \n            Report of 1703, it is noted as recently placed on the \n            shelves. \n         William Camden   transcribed fols 18v-23v, art. 2 (Jeanin\u2019s \n            eulogy invmemory  of Henry  IV of France), from an \n           original borrowed  from the Cotton library. His letter \n            returning it (Jul. C.III, fol. 63) is undated but the \n           transcript was made  on 12 June  1619 (fol. 23v). The \n           original, which Camden   described as  \u2018a rare piece\u2019, \n           seems  to have disappeared. He  also appears to have \n           taken some  of the material in this volume from a \u2018dis- \n           course\u2019 on France by George Carew (d. 1612): see fol. 32, \n           an index to many (though not all) of the previous folios, \n           and MS  Smith  140, p. 4, where Smith names Carew as \n           Camden's  source. However, the folio numbers of two \n           items in the index are outside the scope of this volume. \n         Fols 30-31y, part of art. 4, contain a discussion of Roman \n           coins. Three are illustrated on fol. 30 where Camden \n           has a marginal note: \u2018Ex observationis Peirescii ad Rob \n           Cottonus, & me  missus Febr 1618. Anni Juliani\u2019.",

The \n      latter may be a simple error: the article is followed by \n      letters from the Emperor Henry to the papacy. If loan \n      2.59 does refer to this manuscript, the reference there \n      establishes that Fleetwood owned  fols 2-15, artt. 1-9 \n      (integral with the papal correspondence at artt. 5 and \n      6) and  fols 95-110, art. 14. In that event, Fleetwood\u2019s \n      manuscript  must  have been broken  up between  1621 \n      (the date of loan 2.59) and the moment of the entry in \n      36682  (which lists Dom. VIII in its modern form). The \n      probability is that that entry was written before 1631 \n      because an amendment  to the description of art. 14 (art. \n      13 in 36682)  is almost certainly in Cotton\u2019s hand. If \n      Fleetwood\u2019s manuscript was broken up, this may explain \n      why  an extract, almost certainly from this manuscript, \n      can no  longer be found in it. This extract, taken from \n     correspondence between  Paschal and Henry, was printed \n      by James  Ussher (from a \u201cMS. in Biblioth. Cottonian.\u2019) \n      in his De  Christianarum  ecclesiarum ... successione \n      (London,  1613), p. 181, and see also p. 187. \n    The  annotation on fol. 29v is very likely to be by Camden \n      and, in view of his ownership of art. 11, may indicate \n      that he also owned  fols 16-29, art. 10. It is also just \n      possible that the annotations in an italic hand at the \n     foot  of fols 82v and 83 are in his hand, and Nigel \n      Ramsay   has  suggested  (BL,  Department   of MSS \n      records) that the letter to Camden of December  1618 \n      from  Nicolas-Claude  Fabri de Peiresc, in which he \n      expressed an interest in borrowing \u2018Robertus Montensis, \n      may  refer to fols 71v-94y, art. 13, of this manuscript \n      (Smith, Camden's Correspondence, pp. 266-68). \n    For Ussher'\u2019s extracts, made when art. 11 was still owned by \n      Camden,  see Bodl., MS Add.

He also establishes \n      that this is the only manuscript in the Cotton collection \n      to contain a reference published by Lisle in 1623 in A \n      Saxon  Treatise from  Book  I of the  Liber Eliensis. \n      Finally, he suggests that the erased inscription on fol. \n      95 (see above) can be read as including the letters \u2018Au\u2019 \n      and \u2018t) probably of \u2018Augustine\u2019, Lindsell\u2019s first name. \n      However,  the difficulty with his identification is that \n      there is compelling evidence  that Dom.  XV  was  in \n      Cotton\u2019s hands well before 1622. Loan 71.37, above, to \n      Arthur Agarde, d. 1615, reads: \u2018Item a Book of Ely in 4*\u00b0 \n      old bound having the lyf of St Ethelred in it it was Mr \n      Austen steward\u2019: Dom.  XV  is the only Ely manuscript \n      in the Cotton collection to contain a life of St Etheldreda. \n      Moreover, the fact that Augustine Steward is recorded \n      as previous owner in this loan must open up the possi- \n      bility that the inscription on fol. 95 contained that \n      family\u2019s name, rather than Lindsell\u2019s and this alterna- \n      tive gains strength when  the remains  of the erased \n      signature on  fol. 95 are compared   with  the three \n      examples  of a signature in Royal 15 C.VI  (qv). The \n      latter are  those of  Augustine  Styward,  probably \n      Steward\u2019s grandfather. One (on fol. 4) has been heavily \n      erased and replaced by Cotton's signature in precisely \n      the same manner  as the change on fol. 95. Furthermore, \n      both the erased and the other two surviving signatures \n      in the Royal manuscript carry a decoration to the tail of \n      the letter \u2018y in Styward\u2019s surname, and a small part of a \n      similar decoration can be seen below the letter \u2018c\u2019 of \n      \u2018Bruceus\u2019 on fol. 95 of Dom. (where it is certainly not a \n      part of Cotton\u2019s own signature). If, therefore, Dom. XV \n      is to be ruled out as the manuscript passed to Cotton in \n      1622, either Vesp. A.XIX or the manuscript listed as no. \n      271 of 6018  (and now  missing, but discussed in the \n      entry for A.XIX) may  be alternatives. Despite this, it \n      is of course perfectly possible that L'Isle may have \n      consulted Dom.  XV  and  used it as the source of his \n      reference in A Saxon Treatise, although the manuscript \n      at no.  271 could  seemingly  have provided  similar \n      information. \n    This or Nero A.XV, XVI, or Tit. A.I may be the chronicle \n      of Ely which Francis Tate suggested in a letter of 1613, \n      probably  to Cotton, might  be  available: Jul. C.III, \n      fol. 368. \n    Annexes 3a, 5a, 6b.",

This loan to de Laet was arranged, after \n             some  hesitation, by Selden, at the request of John \n             Morris, at a time when the door to the Cotton library \n             was boarded up. Selden sent the manuscript to Claudius \n             Salmasius, not direct to de Laet (who  published an \n             edition of Vitruvius in 1649). It was then entrusted to \n             James Golius when  Salmasius  left for Sweden in July \n             1650 and  subsequently, with Selden\u2019s consent, passed \n             on to Marcus Meibomius.  It remained in Meibomius\u2019s \n             hands (with a manuscript from Selden\u2019s own collection) \n             until at least February 1652. The date of its retrieval by \n             the Cotton library is not known but Selden\u2019s own manu- \n             script had been returned to him before his death in \n             1654.

However,  if this manuscript is \n          indeed the  subject of the loan, the fact that it was \n          in Cotton\u2019s hands by  1606 gives a terminal date by \n          which  the  entries for it in  Savile\u2019s \u2018A catalogue \n          must  have  been written: Watson,  Savile of Banke, \n          pp. 13-14, \n        Fols 158-79y, art. 8, were extracted by Ussher in Bodl., MS",

The annotations by Leland \n       would seem to suggest that the manuscript may have \n       been all of a piece when he owned it, but it is notable \n      that in JBS, p. 471, John Bale listed the Melrose and the \n       Rishanger materials as apparently separate, though \n      contiguous, items in Leland\u2019s library. Moreover, there is \n      also evidence  that the manuscript  may  have  been \n      divided, at least temporarily, or remained divided, after \n       Leland\u2019s time: fol. 76 appears at some stage to have been \n      an outside leaf, as - compared with its successors \u2014 it \n      has  a rather worn appearance; two  page-numbering \n      sequences,  one  no earlier than  the late sixteenth \n      century, begin on that folio and run for a few leaves (the \n      disrupted order being  reflected in sixteenth-century \n      annotations on fol. 77 (top), fol. 77v (foot), ete); and the \n      volume  carries binding instructions by Cotton (on an \n      unnumbered   leaf which was once the front pastedown), \n      while pages  have been  cropped  since Leland made \n      his annotations. The probability therefore is that the \n      two  parts travelled together but remained physically \n      separate until Cotton united them, and this appears to \n      be confirmed by the quire signatures, where there are \n      two more or less contemporary sequences. One sequence \n      runs throughout and is complete; the other appears less \n      regularly but alongside the complete sequence and on \n      the same leaves. The latter is probably in Cotton's hand, \n      and  the complete sequence  was no doubt  entered a \n      little later (by someone else), once the two parts were \n      finally bound together. \n    Loans: Patrick Young, 1621, Henry Montagu, 1621 (2.30); \n      John Selden, c.1638 (163.10). \n    James Ussher asked Selden to make for him extracts from \n      the Melrose chronicle in the Cotton library: Elrington, \n      Works of Ussher, XV, p. 176: letter of 16 April, 1622.",

See Elrington, Works of Ussher, \n            XV, pp. 302-3  and  (for Cotton\u2019s ownership) p. 290. \n            B.IX is also the only Melrose manuscript now surviv- \n          Richard James  made  extracts from this manuscript in \n            Bodl., MS James  28 (SC 3865), p. 116. Other extracts, \n            marked  as from this manuscript, are in James Ware's \n            notebook, Bodl., MS Rawlinson  B.484 (SC 11831), fol.",

The entry for the Eulogium \n                 in 35213, fol. 43v, also lists John de Rupescissa\u2019s work \n                 and  is therefore of TCD MS 497 rather than of Galba \n                 EVIL. \n               The annotation, \u2018Explicit Historiarum, on fol. 271 may be \n                 by John Stow.

Robert \n     Cotton. \n   In \u00a2.1616 Cotton borrowed from Patrick Young a manu- \n     script (once at Hagnaby Abbey) which at the time of the\n\nloan consisted of 13 A.XXI, fols 12-150 + Vesp. B.XI, \n               fols 2-61 (134.12). He removed the material, an English \n               chronicle, which is now  in B.XI, and  returned the \n               depleted manuscript to Young (134.38). There is, how- \n               ever, every chance that, at the same  time, Cotton \n               effected other alterations to the manuscript which now \n               consists of two further sections, a Bible paraphrase on \n               fols 2-11 and a group of articles from Kirkham Priory \n               on fols 151-92. The manuscript as originally borrowed \n               by Cotton came from the Royal library at Westminster \n               and bears the number \u20181146\u2019 from the inventory of that \n               library made in 1542. Such numbers  invariably occur \n               on an opening leaf of a manuscript but in the case of 13 \n               A.XXI  \u20181146\u2019 is found on fol. 14. The Bible paraphrase \n               not only appears before this leaf but is, moreover, not \n               listed in the sixteenth-century note of the manuscript\u2019s \n               contents which is now mounted   on a modern  flyleaf \n               at the front of the volume. As to the Kirkham Priory \n               material on fols 151-92, these too are only one part of a \n               former manuscript of which another part is now found \n               in fols 84-125*, artt. 5-6, of Vesp. B.XI, the very manu- \n               script into which Cotton  had removed  the  English \n               chronicle from Hagnaby. As Cotton  was undoubtedly \n               the agent in dividing the Hagnaby manuscript between \n               Royal MS 13 A-XXI and Vesp. B.XI, he must surely also \n               have been responsible for the similar distribution of the \n               Kirkham  folios. \n             What  must be  the initial stages of Cotton's interest in \n               Royal 13 A.XXI  are his entries among \u2018Books I want\u2019, \n               \u00a2.1609-12, of \u2018A cronicle bound at the end of Imago \n               mundi  < > bosses. 4\"\u00b0\u2018 (130.6: the present Vesp. B.XI, \n               fols 2-61) and \u2018Cronique  de l\u2019'ymage du Monde   et \n               Cronique de Angleterre\u2019 (130.20: Royal 13 A.XXI, fols \n               12-150, an identification I owe to James Carley). These \n               entries indicate that, at that stage, he was hoping to \n               secure all of this material. Although items 6 and 20 are \n               separated in list 130, they must have  been bound \n               together at that time, as indeed the wording of entry 6 \n               allows for. \n             See Ker, MLGB, p. 94; Watson, MLGB   Supp., p. 41; J.P. \n               Carley, John Leland and the contents of the English \n               pre-dissolution libraries: Lincolnshire\u2019, Transactions of \n               the Cambridge Bibliographical Society, 9 (1989), 339 n. \n               13; Carley, \u2018Royal library, pp. 217-18; Tite, \u2018Lost or \n               stolen or strayed\u2019, p. 267; Carley, Libraries of Henry \n               VII, p.

Three \n              extant seventeenth-century lists of these manuscripts \n              were  published  by  Robinson  &  James,  MSS   of \n             Westminster  Abbey, in 1909: List B, a register of bene- \n              factors and their donations, compiled in 1623; List A, \n              drawn up in 1672; and List C which was made for CMA \n              and published there in 1697, three years after almost all \n              the manuscripts had been destroyed by fire. \n            As there can be virtually no doubt that the manuscript of \n              Lucian that Cotton transferred to Patrick Young, c.1616 \n              (134.27), is identical with that given to the Abbey \n              library by Williams in 1623 (CMA, no. 1139), and as \n              there is a strong likelihood that the works of Prosper \n              and Cyprian in the same transaction (49.42, 134.32) \n              followed the same route, to become CMA, no. 1131, it is \n              by no means  impossible that other untraced manu- \n              scripts which passed from Cotton to Young were later \n              also among those presented by Williams to his library. \n              While no  proof of this is available, it is noteworthy \n              that a further four titles, either unidentified or only \n              tentatively identified in the Cotton-Young lists, appear \n              among   Williams\u2019 donation (CMA,   nos 1156, 1185, \n              1260, and  Robinson &  James, MSS   of Westminster \n             Abbey, List  B no. 163) and that, of the total of six \n              manuscripts, five appear in one subsection of list 134 \n              (134.29-33). \n            If these Westminster Abbey books do indeed form a group \n              of manuscripts which passed successively through the \n              hands of Cotton and then Young, it is tempting to think \n              that Williams solicited them from one or other as a gift. \n              But as the 1623 register (List B) reads, these manu- \n              scripts were given by Williams rather than by someone",

For \n    several related reasons, the Mary Talbot who was the \n    sister of Aletheia Talbot, countess of Arundel, would \n    appear to be the most probable of the candidates. Mary \n    was mentally handicapped (which could account for the \n    crudeness of the annotation) and if her association with \n    the manuscript is correct it would seem more likely to \n    have belonged to her sister or brother-in-law than to \n    her (perhaps to be annotated by her during a visit to \n    them). The  close associations between the Arundels \n    and  Cotton could  then explain the transfer of the \n   manuscript to him and his readiness to return it to the \n    earl (with a number of other outstanding manuscripts) \n    on an extended loan. \n  Loan: Thomas  Howard,  earl of Arundel, by 1631 (113.14). \n    See also loan 271. The loan to Howard was almost cer- \n    tainly the occasion of the manuscript\u2019s loss from the \n    Cotton library.

The charter, once bound with the \n    manuscript  and   now  Aug.
