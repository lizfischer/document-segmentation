In red buckram box-case. \n\nTuere can be little doubt that this copy was especially bound for Sir Francis Bacon \nfor presentation although it contains no inscription. The evidence for this assertion \nis that there are now traceable seven other large-paper copies similarly bound, one of \nwhich was certainly a presentation copy as it is inscribed in the hand of the recipient \n\u2018Ex dono authoris\u2019ff. The seven copies are the Holkham Hall, Folger Library, F.B. \nBemis, R.Redman, L.Wilmerding, 0.D.Young, and the copy sold at Sotheby\u2019s, 20 \nDecember 1937, Lot 552\u00a7. It might be objected that it is odd that an author should \nput his own arms on copies of his works intended for presentation}. However, although \nit may be unusual, it is not unknown, e.g. Edward Benlowes and Archbishops Laud \nand Usher. \nThe copies which occur in these \u2018presentation\u2019 bindings, as well as at least some eight \nor ten other traceable copies, are printed on large-paper, i.e. paper which has a large \ncrown watermark. Such copies measure, in original binding, about thirteen inches in \nheight. The small-paper copies are printed on paper having a jug watermark and, in \noriginal binding, measure less than twelve inches in height. The large-paper copies can \nbe demonstrated to have been printed after all the small-paper copies had passed \nthrough the press because in the large-paper copies all but one of the errors in pagi- \nnation, as well as two of the errors listed in the errata of the second issue, are corrected; \n\ntLike the other known copies which have Bacon\u2019s crest on vellum bindings, this copy has a single-line \nborder, enclosing a double-line frame with a fan-shaped bundle of flower (? thistle) design at each corner, \nthe spine spaced with small gilt ornament between triple lines, gilt. \nttViz. the copy at Holkham Hall which was presented to Sir Edward Coke and, besides this inscription, \nhas several doggerel verses written by him, e.g. \u2018It deserveth not to be read in Schooles, but to be fraughted \nin = ship of fooles.\u2019 which refers, of course, to the engraved title, see C.W.James Chief Justice Coke 1929, \nPp.38-9. \n\u00a7Copies bound like the present and probably identifiable with those listed above have been sold at Puttick\u2019s: \n28 May 1879 (B.M.Pickering sale), and at Sotheby's: 10 June 1918, Lot 46; 23 November 1925, Lot 21 \n(with crest superimposed on center ornaments); 23 February 1926, Lot 313; and 11 April 1927, Lot 471. \nThe large-paper copy recorded at Chatsworth may possibly be bound like the present. \nThe presentation copy in the Bodleian, apparently received in 1621 (cf. Macray 2nd edit. p.63), is \nbound in velvet with Bacon\u2019s crest on sides. The University Library Cambridge copy has a presentation \nletter inserted but it is also bound in velvet with the University arms and Bacon\u2019s crest. \njaThis ep was used by Bacon for marking some books in his own library; these usually have notes in \nBacon\u2019s hand, Examples are now rarely found but the Antwerp Polyglot Bible 169-72 at Jesus College \n\nOxford any be cited as a particularly fine example on vellum. The Strozzi Poetae Pater et Filius 1530, sold \nat Sotheby\u2019s 27 February 1932, see facsimile, is a good example on a calf binding. \n\n[ #& ]\n\nwhereas in some of the small-paper copies pp.g1 and 311 of the text, and 27 and 30 of \nthe Parasceue are misnumbered 96, 111, 35, and 38, respectively. In other small-paper \ncopies, some of these errors are corrected. The corrections were doubtless made in the \npress and the sheets gathered, for the ordinary copies, indescriminately. \nWhen first issued, e.g., the present, this book contained no \u2018Errata\u2019, and the colo- \nphon, on verso [e3], read as above with the names of both Norton and Bill. Later, a list \nof errata was prepared. It was inserted by cancelling leaf [e3]ta and printing the pas- \nsage beginning \u2018Non abs re fuerit . . . \u2019, which formerly was on recto [\u00a23], the list \nof \u2018Errata\u2019, and a new colophontfa, all on recto [e4] which in the first issue was blank. \nSee reproduction of the second issue in Secret Shakespearean Seals by Fratres Roseae \nCrucis, 1916, Plate XXV. Copies of the first issue are of considerable rarity. \nIn 1638, Richard Whitaker published F.Baconi operum moralium et civilium tomus \nwhich included the De Augmentis Scientiarum, the first part of the Instauratio Magna. \nTo some copies Whitaker prefixed another title which declared \u2018Adjecti sunt in calce \noperis libri duo Instaurationis magnae\u2019, i.e. the two books of the Nooum Organum, and \nto such copies he appended the sheets of the present, which is the second part of the \nInstauratio Magna. Copies of the Operum with that third issue of the Novum Organum \nare uncommon; only six can be traced. \nThe importance of the Novum Organum in the history of scientific thought can \nhardly be exaggerated. \u2018We should form an inadequate conception of the Novum \nOrganum if we were to regard it merely as a portion of the Instauratio. For it contains \nthe central ideas of Bacon\u2019s system, of which the whole of the Instauratio is only the \ndevelopment.\u2019 It fully explains Bacon\u2019s philosophic reasoning founded upon the new \nInductive method and was prepared throughout with the utmost care. Later genera- \ntions have recognized its importance and it is constantly referred to as a landmark in \nthe advancement of human thought\u00a7z. To possess such a book in the condition of the \npresent copy is surely to attain the summit of bibliophilic pleasure. \n\nfaThe Joseph Knight copy, now in the Chapin Library, has Sig [e3] merely mutilated, not completely \nremoved. \ntleThis colophon reads: \u2018LONDONI, | Apud IOANNEM BILLIVM, | Typographum Regium. | M.DC.XX \nover-rule]. |\u2019. There was at this time considerable confusion in regard to the King\u2019s Printing Office. From \nthe evidence of the imprints of proclamations, it appears that, through July 1620, Robert Barker and \nJohn Bill were in partnership. From July through November, Bonham Norton and John Bill were in \ncontrol. During December, John Bill\u2019s name alone appears. The excision of Norton\u2019s name from the sec- \nond issue colophon may perhaps be explained by these circumstances. It is probable that the actual \nprinting was done by John Bill, alone. \n\u00a7aKing James, who sometimes made foolish remarks rather well put, said of this book that \u2018it is like the \npeace of God, which passeth all understanding\u2019. \n\nHuntineton C.L., 18.

The S.N.Levy copy, according to Mr.L.C.Harper, does not have the catch- \nword on verso [b4] which would indicate that Holland\u2019s verses are a late insertion. \nThe sheets (D*; D(repeated)*) containing the abnormal signatures are, as has been \nascertained from an examination of three copies in original vellum, two normal quarto \nsheets sewn properly between the second and third leaves of each sheet but signed as \nabove. As Dr. McKerrow has suggested, Introduction p.229n, these sheets must have \nbeen reprinted though for what reason cannot be ascertained. \nThe address, To the Reader, sheet H, is a protest against two insults which Coryate \nsomewhat quixotically singled out in the pirated publication of the commendatory \nverses of the Crudities which appeared in 1611 under the title The Odcombian Banquet \n[g-v.]. It is probable that this address is an addition and that the book originally \nextended only through sheet G, because the blank [G4] need not otherwise have \noccurred, and furthermore because the Cram\u00e9e is mentioned on the title of The Odcom- \nbian Banquet against which this appended address is a protest. Copies without the \naddress, sheet H, therefore must have been in circulation before The Odcombian Ban- \nquet was published. No such copy can now be traced. \nCopies in original vellum, e.g. the fine copy at Bexhill with the Prince of Wales\u2019s \nfeathers, the Chapin, and another at Holkham Hall, are not any larger than the present. \n\nThe Capell copy has inserted 4 ami \nmatter of the Crudities. \u00bb query coevally, sheets a-b\u2018, c-g8, h-l* from the preliminary \n\nS.T.C. 5807.

Sir Philip Sidney is made a good deal of in both, and it is probable \nthat one could list a number of parallel lines and phrases. They both reveal about the \nsame mastery of this kind of verse, e.g. in the Cadwallader, verso [Gg], one of the \nstanzas on \u2018The losse of Elizabeth\u2019: \nBright Gem of honor, Albions glorious starre, \nThe Cynosure of Englands Hemispheare: \nPrincesse of peace, Cytherian queene of warre, \nRides through the cloudes on her caelestiall beare, \nConquering deathes Ebon dart and sharpest speare. \nFather of peace put on triumphant weedes, \nA gratious King, a gratious Queene succeedes. \nwhich may be compared in the present with one of the stanzas of \u2018A memoriall of our \nlate renowned Elizabeth\u2019, verso [C4]: \nThy glories I admire, celestiall starre, \nEarthes ornament, whom heaven smiles to see, \nWonder of women, Queene of peace and warre, \nElizabeth, Saint, daine me leave to bee \nThy honours trumpe, sith no man speakes of the: \nSleepe still bright Angel, for thy head shall have \nA Crowne in heaven, though on the earth a gravett. \nMr. Ulric Nisbet has recently sought to prove that the author of Cadwallader is \nSir William Herbert of Red Castle, who was made a Knight of the Bath in 1603 and \nEarl of Powis in 1629\u00a7. His identification rests upon the use by Nicholas Breton, in \nthe dedication of his Wits trenchmour 1597 to Sir William Herbert of Red Castle, of the \nproverb \u2018to make a large gate of a little Towne\u2019, and its appearance also in Cadwallader, \nll.15-17, verso B3: \nLeast that my Gates be wider then my towne, \nAnd that Diogines my folly see: \nMy proems prologue Ile set quickly downe\u2019 . . . . \nBut, as Prof.A.W.Baldwin has pointed out (7.Z.S. 12 June 1937) in both cases the \nreference is to a well known story of Diogenes who told the citizens of the small town \nof Minda to shut their \u2018mightie great gates, that the towne run not out\u2019. It probably \nalso was current in the form of a proverb although it is not listed in any of the collec- \ntions we have consulted. However, it is recorded, it is true at a slightly later date, in \n\nt#On this same subject the author has included a Spenser reference which is apparently unrecorded, 1I.3-5, \nverso [C4]: \nA hundred tongues they be too few I weene, \nTo trump such fame; grave Spenser live a space, \nAnd leave the grave, this monument to grace: \nIn the Cadwallader there is another reference, !.9, verso H2: \nSpenser the Muses sonne and sole delight: \nThe metre used in both these poems is the one that Spenser used in his Hymnes. \n\u00a7 The Onlie Begetter Longmans, 1936, an attempt to identify the \u2018Mr.W.H.\u2019 of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets. See \nalso London Times Literary Supplement 12 and 19 June 1937. \n\n[ ev ]\n\nthe form: \u2018Make not the door wider than the house\u2019, while its use by Breton and the \nauthor of Cadwallader seems very slight evidence upon which to build such a structure, \nIndeed, it is hardly possible, whoever else he may have been, that the author of \nCadwallader was Sir William Herbert of Red Castle for in the second dedication to \nSir Philip Herbert (Cadwallader 1.7, verso 1) the author says \u2018These Poems which my \ninfant labours send\u2019a. Sir William was no infant in 1604; he was born 1572-3. The \nauthor also says of Christ Church College Oxford, Il.1-2, verso G3: \nNurse of ingenious spirits Athens praise, \nChiefe benefactor of what ere is mine: \nwhich might be construed as indicating that he was an alumnus of that college. Sir \nWilliam Herbert of Red Castle is not known to have attended either university. \nFurthermore, William Gamage (Linsie Woolsie 1613, Century II, Epigram 92) ad- \ndressed the author of Cadwallader, \u2018To the ingenious Poet, Mr. William Herbert of his \nbooke intituled the Prophesie of Cadwalader\u2019. Sir William Herbert of Red Castle was \nmade a Knight of the Bath in 1603. \nThere is, on the other hand, a \u2018William Herbert, probably son of William Herbert \nof Glamorgan\u2019 who, according to Sir Sidney Lee, would have been no more than 21 \nyears of age in 1604, who matriculated at Christ Church College in 1600, and who \napparently was never knighted. But whether or not the particular William Herbert \nwho wrote Cadwallader can be identified, it seems not unlikely that he was the author \nof the present \u2018Epitaphs\u2019. \nThe title under which this work was originally entered by Rocket was: \u2018Honors \nEpitaphes or the Lamentation of Brittaine for the vntimely Losse of many woorthie \nlate personages whiche haue lyued in this Isle\u2019. Just why the title was altered to \n\nemphasize the Earl of Essex (only eight pages of text are devoted to him) can only \nbe conjecturedta. \n\nfaSir Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, was first cousin to Sir William Herbert of Red Castle, but \nnowhere in the Cadwallader is any mention of this relationship. In the present work, verso 12, four stanzas \nare devoted to an eulogy of William, rst Earl of Pembroke, in which, likewise, there is no mention of \nrelationship. \ntalt may be, however, that the suppression of Robert Pricket\u2019s Honors fame in triumph riding 1604 may \nhave caused Rocket to alter the title in order to attract purchasers who might think little of a mere \npoetical lamentation. The suppression is noted in Hist. MSS. Com. Rep. 10, App. 2, 1885, p.92, ina letter \nfrom F.Morice to Sir B. Gawdy, 7 June 1604, which reads: \u2018Morice also sends a lately published poem \nconcerning the whole life and death of the late Earl of Essex . . . well and feelingly written and I think \nwill not hereafter to be had as they are already called in and the printer called in question\u2019. \n; After Elizabeth\u2019s death several pieces were published concerning the late Earl of Essex. Bacon\u2019s 4polo- \nSie [q-v.] went through several editions, 4n apologie of the Earle of Essex 1603, was the subject of con- \nine! te the wardens of the Stationers\u2019 Company between Richard Bradock, the printer, and John \nes oe \u2014 6 August 1604, to pay Smethwick five pounds in settlement). That \nae cragaal wats a ae and Published at Middleburgh in 1603, and several manuscript copies of \nihesheh gf ig! 7 jee nown, e.g. Huntington and R.Redmond. 4 lamentable dittie composed upon \nou of Essex 1603 went through at least two editions. Judging by the popularity \n\nof the foregoing, it i \u2018 \u2018 * i \navis aa 's possible that \u2018Essex\u2019 was still, in 1606, a name which might help to sell such a volume \n\n[ xxvi ]\n\nAlthough, in \u2018The Author to his Booke\u2019, \u2018H.W.Gent.\u2019 says: \u2018I knowe these lines are \nbad\u2019, they are certainly no worse than much of the contemporary poetry which has \nbeen thought worthy of reprinting and one may well believe that the reason they have \nnot been rescued from obscurity is probably because, hitherto, the only copy known \nwas in the Bodleian Library. \n\nS.T.C. 12582.

FOR CORVETTO. \nCorvetto much with Holinshed did rage, \nThat chronacling the writers of his age, \nWhen roome enough was left him in the page, \nHe did forget to place among the rest \nA famous learned writer of the West: \nAnd who was that? Corvetto? No I iest: \nCorvetto wrote but once a singing note, \nWhat though? should such a writer be forgote? \nSince he had once in Ballad royall wrote. \nFor Stanyhurst hath chronicled therefore, \nOne Dormer: so should Holinshed no more \nHaue done, then one (he knew) had done before. \nO on our manners, and 6 on our time? \nMust he be made writer, that made but a rime? \nAs a fair example of Joyner\u2019s shorter epigrams, Boxe III, 7 may be cited: \nA FAMIL. FOR MERCHAT. \nThere is no good trusting Merchat in neede, \nThough it be true, that his worde is his deede. \nWhen he hath said, he hath done, and thats all, \nHe that hath his worde, hath his deede withall. \nA knaue he is, whose worde and deed be one, \nIf his worde be all, and his deede be none.",

The \npresent copy belongs to the so-called \u2018Bindley\u2019 edition}. It contains the full text of \nSir John Davies\u2019s epigrams, but like the so-called \u2018Isham\u2019, the presumptive second \nedition, known only by the Lamport copy in the Huntington Library, it has only a \nselection of ten of Marlowe\u2019s forty-eight elegies. Both editions contain the poem of \n\u2018IGNOTO\u2019 which does not occur in any of the other editions, and, except that the \nIsham edition is somewhat compressed in size\u2014 though with ample margins it measures \nonly 41/46 x 3 inches\u2014they are identic paginary impressions. \nThe reasons for believing this to be the first, at least of extant editions, are as follows. \nWhen, in 1599, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London ordered the \nStationers\u2019 Company to seize and burn certain books{ the present was cited as \u2018Davyes \nEpigrams with Marlowes Elegyes\u2019 (Arber III, 677), i.e. the edition ordered seized \napparently contained the epigrams before the elegies as in the Bindley and Isham \neditions but the reverse of their positions in the four other extant editions. Presumably, \ntherefore, the edition ordered to be seized was either the Bindley, the Isham, or an \nedition like them not now extant. An examination of the variant readings of all six \neditions given by Professor C.F.Tucker Brooke shows that in Marlowe\u2019s elegies the \nBindley and Isham editions have numerous readings in common which are not pre- \nserved in any of the other editions. In those cases where the Bindley and Isham editions \ndiffer, there are thirty instances in which the readings of the Isham edition are the \nsame as all the other editions and only three instances where the Bindley readings are \nthe ones preserved. It is possible that most of the Bindley readings might be described \nas corruptions due to carelessness in reprinting but they may equally well have been \nmisreadings of the manuscript copy which were corrected in the Isham edition mainly \nby simple correction of number, gender, or sense, or else by comparison with a better \nmanuscript. Furthermore, there is circumstantial evidence that the present edition \nis earlier than the Isham. This copy was formerly, the volume was divided by Sotheby\u2019s, \nbound with Robert Joyner\u2019s Jtis 1598 (Lot 212, in the Newhailes sale, now also in this \ncollection), whereas the Isham copy is still bound in coeval vellum with two books \ndated 1599. It is true that the binding of the present copy is not the original one but \nthe collocation is certainly worth noting. \nIn footnote} of No.641, it is stated that the signatures in both the present and the \nIsham editions are in Robert Waldegrave\u2019s peculiar manner. Though Waldegrave was \n\n{This edition receives its name from the circumstance that hitherto it has been known only from the imper- \nfect, lacking Sig [A4], Bindley (I, 1818, Lot 1776, bought by Hibbert, returned as imperfect and resold \nIII, 1819, Lot 2211)-Heber (IV, 1834, Lot 1490)-British Museum copy. That copy differs from the present \nin the imprint on recto E, the alteration having apparently been made in the press. In it Middleburgh is \nspelled \u2018Middleborough\u2019 and is without the concluding period. \n{Nine books were at that time listed of which four are now in this collection, viz. besides the present, Hall\u2019s \nVirgidemiarum, and Marston\u2019s Pigmalion and Scourge. \n\n[ xxx ]\n\nthe King\u2019s Printer in Edinburgh and is chiefly known as a printer of puritanical litera- \nture he was also the printer of the Edinburgh piracy of Sidney\u2019s Arcadia 1599 which \nwas intended for surreptitious sale in Englandt{. These epigrams and elegies were \nnever entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register and, therefore, Waldegrave did not infringe \nupon some English publisher\u2019s copyright. It is not unlikely, however, that an English \nbookseller sought to have them licensed for publication in England, was refused, and, \ninstead of having them surreptitiously printed in England, arranged to have Walde- \ngrave print them in Edinburgh. \nThe excessive rarity of the early editions of this book is due perhaps not so much to \nthe fact that they were officially burned as it is to the character of their contents. They \nwere considered then to be licentious and, even to modern taste, they have the same \nflavor\u00a7. These books were probably thumbed nearly out of existence. But it is not \nmerely as bibliographic rarities or as examples of Elizabethan erotica that they are \nesteemed today. It is true that Marlowe\u2019s elegies are feebly translated. Except for an \noccasional flashing phrase, they are juvenil work. But Sir John Davies\u2019s epigrams are \na landmark in English literature. With their appearance the epigram, imitated from \nMartial, comes into its own as a medium of social satire. \nIn his remarks on the English epigram in The Metamorphosis of Ajax 1596, Sir John \nHarington refers to Sir John Davies\u2019s Epigram 29. It is possible, from the tone of his \nremarks, that at least one edition of the present had been published at that time. \n\nHCE. The Library 1 (1900) pp.195-205.

The evidence which Haslewood \nmarshalled is not conclusive although there is reason to believe that Nashe was some- \nhow or other concerned in this publication. What the nature of the quarrel was, whether \nother publications connected with it were published, and the identity of the railing \nvituperator who composed this \u2018Pil\u2019 are still problems which have not been solved. \nThe book is dedicated to \u2018Maifter Baw-waw\u2019 whom Haslewood believed to be Nashe \nhimself on the grounds that he used the name in his Lenten stuffe (q.v.] in a manner \nwhich Haslewood believed was intended to refer to himself but which Dr. McKerrow \nregards as merely a proverbial expression. The dedicator, who signs himself \u2018Yours his \nblue vaine\u2019, declares that \u2018mooued through affection, as alfo hearing of your arriuall \ninto England, I haue made bolde to dedicate this my fimple labor vnto you. . . \u2019. \nThe phrase in Nashe\u2019s Lenten stuffe \u2018after my returne from Ireland\u2019, which Sir Sidney \nLee regarded as an announcement that Nashe was about to go there and Fleay that \nhe had been there serving in the war, is interpreted by Dr. McKerrow as an imaginary \nspeech of the \u2018Brauamente segniors\u2019 and not Thomas Nashe. In Dr. McKerrow\u2019s judg- \nment, therefore, Baw-waw is unlikely to be Nashe. \nThere are, however; other references in the book which indicate some relationship \nto Nashe and his coterie, e.g.: \u201cHerringcobs inuentions\u2019tt, 1.15, recto A3; \u2018Lenton \nrelictes\u2019, 19, recto Aq; and possibly \u2018becaufe fhe thought that a red Hearring was not \na difh daintie enough to feaft fo royall a gueft as a Commaunder\u2019, II.3-5, verso [Ba]. \nThe date of the present pamphlet may perhaps be established as sometime early in \n1599. Nashe\u2019s Lenton stuffe was entered 11 January of that year, though written in \n1598, and was presumably published soon after because, 1 June 1599, \u2018all Nasshes \nbookes and Doctor Harvyes bookes [were ordered to] be taken wheresoeuer they maye \nbe found and that none of theire bookes bee euer printed hereafter\u2019 (Arber III, 677). \nIf much of the edition of the Lenten stuffe then remained unsold it would presumably \n\ntAccording to Lowndes (IV, 186s, p.1867) a copy of this book was sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 1860. We have not \nbeen able to trace the sale but that copy was probably the present one for no other copy is known. \nttAbout this time there seems to have been an inexplicable interest in herrings for, besides Nashe\u2019s Lenten \nstuffe 1599, the text of which is headed \u201cThe praise of the red herring\u2019, there is Richard Carew\u2019s 4 herring\u2019s \ntayle 1598 which might in its obscurities have some relation to the present, and the translation of Jan van \nDoetecum\u2019s tract, 4 most strange and wonderful herring taken neere Drenton 1598, which is one of the \nnumerous class announcing the discovery of mysteriously marked fish and certainly has no relation to \n\nthe present work. \n\n[ xxxv ]\n\nhave been seized and recorded among the books destroyed at that time, and the book \nwould presumably be much rarer than it now is. In the postscript of the present, \n1l.24-7, verso [Ba], the author suggests \u2018that Chollericke Pill of hers will eafely be \ndigefted with one pleafant conceit or other of Mounfier de Kempe [William Kempe, \nthe comedian] on Monday next at the Globe, where I would gladly meete you, if your \nleyfure will fo permit\u2019. Now Kempe was not playing in London from the first Monday \nin Lent, 8 March 1599, when he left on his jigging tour to Norwich, until September \n1601, when he returned and joined Worcester\u2019s company. If it may be admitted that \nthe phrases \u2018Lenton relictes\u2019, etc. refer to Nashe\u2019s book, then the publication date of \nthe present volume was sometime during the first three months of 1599. \nAlthough the identity of the railers who participated in this controversy cannot be \nestablished, the text itself is not so obscure that, taking it at its face value, some sort \nof outline of the contents of the present tract may not be sketched. After the dedica- \ntion is a letter signed \u2018She that skornes thee and thy puffie ftuffe: Snuffe.\u2019 which \nthreatens that if the \u2018rubbifh and outcaft of your Herringcobs inuentions\u2019 should be \nprinted \u2018I will fo caftice thee inflicting difmall corafiues vpon thy fainting foule . . . \u2019 \nThen follows an answer signed \u2018He that loues thee and thy fnuffie ftuffe, Snipfnap.\u2019, \nwhich states that \u2018I do perfeueere in my {curuie louzie meaning, to beray & betray the \nworld with my flattring Papers like fixe pennie gigges, and to haue them printed\u2019. He \nalso states that he has received Snuffe\u2019s letter \u2018which I haue anfwered with a crowding \nfpirit\u2019. This answer then follows and forms the major section of the book, eight pages. \nIt consists of a long string of, mostly alliterative, abuse. At the end is a postscript \nwhich is apparently addressed to Snuffe and her sister and which shows the artificiality \nof this quarrel. \nNo other copy of this book can be traced and the location of the present copy was \nunknown to Dr. McKerrow when he was editing The Works of Thomas Nashe. Its \nrarity may perhaps be due to the circumstance that it was privately printed, as indi- \ncated by the omission of imprint, and that very few copies were ever issued. The clue \nto the problems which it raises may still exist and, until they are solved, this book must \nremain an interesting, though baffling, puzzle.",

An unidentified owner has written his name \n\u2018henrye ffeilde\u2019 with the date \u20181641\u2019 on a blank which probably, even at that early date, had \nbeen inserted to reinforce the preliminary blank leaf. \nSeveral collectors of the Georgian era are indicated: George North (1710-1772), the numismatist, \nwho wrote, on the title-page, \u2018Suum cuiqz G North 1753\u2019; Dr. Michael Lort (1725-1790), \nNorth\u2019s executor and to whom he bequeathed part of his library, who signed his name \u2018MLort\u2019 \non the blank; and James Bindley (1737-1818) whose inscription on the inside of the vellum \ncover speaks for itself: \u2018James Bindley. F.S.A. Stamp-Office, London. 1793.\u201d \nAfter the Bindley sale (1,1818, Lot 672){a, this copy went to William Esdaile (1758-1837), the \nprint collector, whose initials on the title are dated \u20181823\u2019 and followed by \u2018No 674\u2019. His books \nwere sold 15 March 1838. On the 10 April 1838t4 this copy was acquired by The British Museum \nwhere it remained throughout the ensuing one-hundred years when it entered this library. \n\nTuus first edition of the most famous of English essays is an attractive octavo. It is well \nprinted, much care is given to the ornamentation and there are surprisingly few errors. \nThe second edition, also dated 1597, is a duodecimof{a. The text-page is smaller than \n\n{In this section, the headlines read: \u2018A Table of the Coulers [colours] | of good and euill. |\u2019. \n{{Edmund Malone mentioned this \u2018Bindley copy\u2019 in a note written in his copy of the second edition (now \nin Trinity College Cambridge). In that note dated \u20181799\u2019 he wrote, \u2018There was I find, another editn. in \n1597. It is an 8vo in Mr Bindley\u2019s Collection. This is in 12mo\u2014I believe the 8vo was the first, and this \nthe second; for in the Meditationes Sacre (D 3 verso) in this edit. there is an out as the printers call it, \n[deletion]: ignoratus voluntatus Dei; . . . \n\u00a7Anthony Bacon, the dedicatee, presented a copy to his patron, the Earl of Essex, which, from the endorse- \nment on Anthony\u2019s letter accompanying the book, was received the day after the present copy was \npurchased, cf. Spedding Works of F.Bacon VI, pp.s21-2. \nfaThis was bought by Robert Triphook, bookseller, for 3l. 6s. \ntaThe British Museum cipher, in pencil on the verso of title, indicates that this was the seventh book \n\nacquired on that date. It reads: \u201838. | 4.7. | 10. |\u2019. The British Museum bought this copy from William \nPickering, bookseller, for s1. 5s. \n\nHaRecorded by S. de Ricci in \u2018The Book Collector\u2019s Guide\u2019, 1921. \n\n[ xxxviit ]\n\nin the first edition, fewer ornaments are used, and the mistakes of the earlier are \ncorrected\u00a7a. The third edition [see No.27], also a duodecimo, is dated 1598. The set-up \nof that edition is smaller in size than the preceding edition and too is less impressive. \nA comparison of the second and third editions shows some slight variations in spelling, \nabbreviations, etc. These differences are inconsequential and appear to be the result of \nthe compositor\u2019s need to cramp or to extend the text in spacing the type within the line. \nThis first edition, like the other two sixteenth century editions, contains not only \nthe literary \u2018Essaies\u2019 but has appended Bacon\u2019s religious work the \u2018Meditationes \nSacre\u2019 and also his philosophical \u2018The Colours of good and euill\u2019. The \u2018Essaies\u2019 as here \n\n\u00a7Below are comparative readings of the first and second editions. The third is similar to the second edition. \nBacon Essays \n\n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\n1597 1597 1597 1597 1597 1597 \nOcTAVO DUODECIMO OCTAVO DUODECIMO OCTAVO DUODECIMO \nfol. line fol. line fol. line fol. line fol. line fol. line \n[Essays] [Meditations] [Colors] \nvI 5 vi 8 v7 or vag v26 4 v59 3 \n. + mencon- | men con- | meliorare + inchoare ..

The text of the Darius as here \nreprinted has been largely purged of Scotticisms, and consequently a comparison of it \nwith the edition of 1603 (q.v.] has been found to be of considerable philological value. \nThis edition of Darius is sometimes found separated from Croesus and it has been sug- \ngested, though without much foundation, that such copies may have been advance \npresentation copies. \nWhile only eight other copies of this edition can be located, several others are re- \ncorded in the auction records, most of them, it is true, not bound up with the other \npieces as in the copy here described. \n\nS.T.C. 343.

He brought with him his old block of the Stuart royal \narms but very little, if anything, else. By arrangement with Allde he was allowed to set- \nup this volume with Allde\u2019s types and ornaments though, perhaps because Alexander \nwas still in Edinburgh and it was only in Scotland that he could expect to sell this book, \nhe affixed the Edinburgh imprint. It is possible that the device, which had been Wolfe\u2019s \nwas then the property of Waldegrave and had been brought from Edinburgh by him} \nbut it is not known to have been used there by him. \nOnly seven other copies are located, viz. the British Museum, Scottish National \nLibrary (Roxburghe), Bodleian (Malone), Huntington (Bridgewater), Harvard (Huth- \nWhite), Folger, and a copy now owned by the Rosenbach Company. \n\n{Waldegrave first used this method of signing in 1583, and thereafter, except in folios where it naturally could \nnot be employed, e.g. Sir John Skene\u2019s The laws and actes, 1597, he used it consistently. The only exception \nwe have noted is in his edition of Napier\u2019s 4 plaine discouery, 1593, where, except in sheet L which is signed \nin his usual manner, the sheets are signed \u2018X, 2, X3, and 4.\u2019 Cf. also note on Marlowe\u2019s A/I Ovid\u2019s Elegies. \nRegarding the headpiece on verso [A4] see Preston Cambyses.

With armorial bookplate of Frederick Trench. This copy never had the \ntwo unsigned leaves containing the title and dedication to \u2018A Continuation\u2019 for which see next \nnumber, but it appears to be unique in that it retains the original general-title and dedication, \n\nsee below. \n\nTue entry of this book in the Stationers\u2019 Register is to both Bynneman and Newbery \nbut the entry reads \u2018Receyued of him for his license to print . . . the Romaine Ciuill \nwarres\u2019 which may of course merely signify that Bynneman, who made the entry im- \nmediately preceding it, alone appeared before the master and wardens to obtain the \nlicense. On the other hand, from the evidence of the imprints of the two titles found in \nthis copy, Bynneman alone was originally responsible for the first part. Moreover, as \nthe original title to the first part, see Plate No.II, which has been preserved alone in \nthis copyt shows, it was originally intended to end the book with the death of Sextus \nPompeius, i.e. p.[37\u00b0! (verso Bbb), followed by a leaf of errata (printed as [Bbbg] but \nintended to be bound as [Bbb2]). \nBefore many copies were issued, or, to judge by present survivals, before any copies \nwere issued, Bynneman changed his mind and decided not only to include a \u2018continua- \ntion\u2019 to the \u2018Ciuile\u2019 wars to the death of Antony together with Tables and a new and \nenlarged list of errata, but also to append a second part containing the \u2018Foren\u2019 wars. This \nalteration made it necessary to discard the original title to the first part and to print a \ncancel general-title. The dedication had been kept standing in type and was reprinted \nas the complementary leaf of the cancel general-title; the two leaves, from the water- \nmarks, forming the inner half of sheet Fff. At this time, apparently, Newbery became \nassociated with Bynneman in the enterprise} for his name appears in the imprint of \nmost copies of this cancel title, as well as in the imprint of all copies of the second part. \nThere appear to be three states of this cancel general-title. The earliest is that which \nis prefixed to this copy. It may be distinguished by the fact that \u2018continuation\u2019 in the \nnineteenth line is spelled \u2018continuarion\u2019 and Bynneman\u2019s name appears alone in the \nimprint. The second state, which is the one usually found and which is represented by \nthe copy described below, may be distinguished by the fact that the imprint reads \n\u2018IMPRINTED AT LONDON | dy Raufe Newbery, and | Henrie Bynniman. | Anno. \n1578. |\u2019. The third state, of which the Sheldon copy in the Chapin Library is the only \none which we have traced, may be distinguished by the fact that in it the nineteenth \nline is finally corrected to read\u2018 . . . continuation . . . \u2019and an \u2018I\u2019 is inserted in the \n\u201cRaufe Newbery\u2019 of the second state imprint so that it reads \u2018Raulfe Newbery\u2019. \n\n{This title and the dedication were set-up as the inner half of sheet Bbb and were then meant to be separated \nand placed at the beginning. But in this copy which has the second issue preliminaries prefixed the binder \nneglected to destroy the first issue ones as well as the obsolete errata leaf [Bbb4]. \ntt may be that Newbery\u2019s name was added to the entry in the Stationers\u2019 Register after the entry was \nfirst made because it refers only to the \u2018Ciuill Warres\u2019, but, if so, the fee of two shillings six pence was also a \nlater addition for the two parts, together, occupy 92 sheets which, at the rate of one penny for three sheets, \n_ appears to be the prevailing rate prior to 1582, would, disregarding the odd two sheets, just equal \nthat sum, \n\n[12]\n\nA.

At the same time typographical corrections \nwere introduced on p.207. The new paragraph begins: \u2018And thus againe, it hath bene \nalwayes vsuall among great and magnanimous princes in all ages, not only to repulse \nany injury...\u2019 \nMr.B.M. Ward has (R.\u00a3.S.1(1925) 284) shown that the traditional ascription of this \nimportant work to George Puttenham cannot be supported by internal evidence. He \nhas presented some ingenious reasons for attributing it to John Lord Lumley, but in \nthat his argument is not strong enough to be considered as proved. Within two years of \npublication apparently it was attributed to Puttenham (WN. & Q. 11th, I, 404) but as \nMr. Ward shows that may have been due to intentional mystification on the part of the \npublisher or publisher and author combined. The sheet with double signature AB is \nperhaps a cancellans}{ replacing original dedicatory and preliminary matter which \nrevealed the identity of the author but which was cancelled for reasons not now known. \n\ntfAn examination of several copies with this in mind seems to show that the second and third leaves of the \nquire AB form a half-sheet not apparently conjugate with the outer two leaves which possibly are all that \nremain of the cancellandum. \n\nS.T.C. 20519.

But these variations have little bibliographical \nimportance, being mere corrections or additions, particularly of marginal references, \nmade while the sheets were passing through the press. For example, in the Grenville \ncopy, the line ending the recto of the first leaf of the Table is repeated at the top of the \nverso. This error appears to have been observed rather soon for all other copies we have \nexamined omit the line from the recto. \nNot only is this the most renowned work on the subject of archery in English or, for \nthat matter, in any language, but its publication marked the beginning of the decline \nof the prejudice in favour of Latin as the literary language of Englishmen for original \ncompositions, the works of Tyndale and Sir Thomas More being the only illustrious \npredecessors easily recalled. For writing this book and presenting it to the king Ascham \nwas granted a pension of \u00a310. \nThirteen copies of this edition can be located of which nearly half are imperfect, \ndoubtless not on account of neglect, but rather the contrary. Two very fine presentation \ncopies are among those traceable, viz. the Edward VI-Sir Anthony Cope copy in the \nMorgan Library, and the William Parr, Earl of Essex-Ashburnham-Trowbridge copy \nin the Bemis collection. \n\nS.T.C. 837.

This copy is some seven millimetres wider than the largest B.M. copy. \n\nTue first quire is known in two distinct settings. In both the type is the same and so are \nthe contents of individual pages and nearly all line endings.

For this reason, as well as because it is the editio \nprinceps of the first book in the literature of bibliophily, it must always obtain a ven- \nerated position in any library so fortunate as to possess a copy. In America these li- \nbraries include the Morgan, Huntington, Yale, C.W.Clark, Chapin, Kane, Wilmerding, \nand the present. \n\n{That printer issued about the same time an edition of Gerson\u2019s Tractatus de laude scriptorum ad Carthusienses \net Celestinos (Hain-Copinger 7688) which is printed in the same type as the present and has the same number \nof lines to the page, the same size of type-page and is upon the same kind of paper. It has been suggested \nthat, as it is concerned with the same subject, that it was issued as an appendix to the Philobiblon. How- \never, no copy can be traced which has the two bound together. \n\nHAIN 4151. B.M. I. 232. VoULLIEME 1021. PELLECHET 3101. HuntincTon C.L., 61. DIBDIN \nBibl. Spenceriana II, 237.

A seven- \nteenth century scholar has compared this text with that of a Christ Church College Oxford \nmanuscript and noted the variants in blank margins. \n\nTue only known copy of the first issue is in the Bodleian. In it the title is from the same \nsetting but is dated \u20181598\u2019, the initials \u2018B.P.N.\u2019 do not occur, and the Appendix (sheet I) \nis not added, the volume ending with the blank, Sig [H4]. \nThe mysterious initials \u2018 B.P.N.\u2019 on the title have been variously interpreted as \u2018Bibli- \nothecae Praefectus Novae\u2019, or \u2018Nostrae\u2019, \u201cBono Publico Natus\u2019, and \u2018Beati Pauli Norma\u2019, \nthis last alluding to the partial quotation from I Corinthians X.33 which follows the \ninitials on the title. Madan is doubtless correctf in preferring the interpretation \u201cBono \nPublico Natus\u2019 by reason that these letters occur again after James\u2019 initials, at the end of \nhis The humble and earnest request, 1625, without any text or motto to which they might \nallude. \nThis edition besides being the first English printing of this foundation book of the \nliterature of bibliophily is also the earliest edition to attempt a collation of more than \none manuscript of the text. The Appendix contains the first \u2018union\u2019 catalogue ever at- \ntempted at Oxford or, for that matter, anywhere else. The first translation into English \nof this work was made by John Bellingham Inglis and published anonymously in Lon- \ndon, 1832, at the expense of the Rev. W.J. Jolliffe. A copy of that translation is in this \nlibrary. \n\n{This view is upheld in an article in The Bodleian Quarterly IV, 71. \n\nS.T.C. 959. | Huntincron C.L., 61. Manan Early Oxford Press 1,47.

At \nfirst glance it would appear that the present was merely an imperfect copy of the \nofficial defence of the action against Essex. Comparison of it with a second issue, how- \never, indicates that the concluding sheets M-Q* were never issued with this copy and \nthat originally Sig [L4] was a blank. The evidence for such a belief is to be found in the \nfact that, though verso L3 in all copies is a blank, the second issue copies have on recto \n13, a catchword \u201c| The\u2019, relating to the subheading on recto [L4]. That catchword does \nnot occur in the present copy. Sig [L4] in the second issue is not a cancel and Sig L1-3 \nare from the same setting in both issues, so that sheet L was evidently passed through \nthe press again for the additional matter. \nApparently after the type in some of the chases had been distributed the demand \nnecessitated their resetting. Though an examination of several copies shows that \nnormally either the first or the second setting occurs throughout\u2014the Chapin copy \nhas them mixed. The first setting (the present) of sheet I may be distinguished by 1. 24 \nrecto I2 which ends \u2018.. . one that |\u2019, while the second ends \u2018 . . . one that of |\u2019. \nSheet Q of the second issue occurs in two settings. In the first the verso Q, line 1, \nreads \u2018hee\u2019, while in the second it reads \u2018he\u2019. The headline Sig [Q4] in the earlier reads \n\u2018Enidence\u2019 which is corrected in the later to \u2018Euidence\u2019, At the same time the tailpiece \nwas changed from one of rather solid character, 24 x 56 mm., to a lighter one with \nbull\u2019s head in centre, 17 x 73 mm. \nThe story of the composition of this account of the trial is told by Bacon in his \nApologyt (q.v.]. Spedding has described it as a \u2018strictly and scrupulously veracious \nnarrative\u2019 while Lord Clarendon, perhaps equally partial, called it \u2018a pestilent libel\u2019. \n\n}According to Bacon, Elizabeth \u2018noted that I could not forget my auncient respect to my Lord of Essex, \nin terming him euer My Lord of Essex, My Lord of Essex, in almost euery page of the booke, which she \nthought not fit, but would haue it made, Essex, or the late Earle of Essex: whereupon of force it was \nprinted de nouo, and, the first copies suppressed by her peremptorie commaundement.\u2019 \n\nS.T.C. 1133.

The Jones (1918, Lot 61) copy with bookplate. \n\nFrom the fact that the 12th October 1612, Hall and Beale, who were in partnership at \nthat timef, entered for this book without transfer it would appear that the changes \nmade by the author in the nine essays here reprinted together with the addition of \ntwenty-nine new ones caused them to regard it as an entirely new publication}. Indeed, \nthis edition ranks with the first of 1597 and the \u2018complete\u2019 of 1625 [q.v.] as one of the \nthree editions which provide an authoritative text. \nThere is another edition of the Essays dated 1612 but printed for John Jaggard. It \nappears that Jaggard began his edition before the present was issued using his 1606 \nedition as copy. For that reason his edition retains the dedication to Sir Nicholas \nBacon, although he had died, and, as first issued, ended on recto [G7] with the word \n\u2018FINIS\u2019{t. The publication of Beale\u2019s edition with the essays more than tripled in \n\n{Hall died before 1 March 1613, when Beale entered into partnership with John Pindley. The latter died \nbefore 2 November 1613. \nThe edition of 1625 which contains still more additions was also granted an original entry and was regarded \nby Bacon in his dedication as \u2018a New Worke\u2019, see next number. \nThe only recorded copy of this first issue was sold at the Pittar Sale November 1918, Lot 49 and is now \nin the Folger Library but the Jolley-Corser copy of the second issue in the British Museum has leaves [G7 \nand 8] uncancelled, while the Steeves copy in the possession of Mr. Roland L. Redmond has G7 uncancelled. \n\nVOL.I [ 33 ]\n\nnumber naturally stopped the sale of Jaggard\u2019s edition. He therefore cancelled Sig [G7 \nand 8], the latter a blank, and printed-off the new essays together with the last page \nof the old as sheets H-O which he added to the sheets of his 1612 reprint of the 1606 \nedition. (For a discussion of the possible means by which Jaggard obtained the right \n\nto reprint Beale\u2019s new essays, see next number). ; \nThe present is the first edition to omit the Meditationes and The Colours of Good and \nEvil and although the table enumerates forty essays there are in reality only thirty- \neight, the two last (\u2018Of the publike.\u2019 and \u2018Of Warre and peace.\u2019) not being included in \nthis nor, as a matter of fact, in any edition. The essay \u2018Of honour and reputation\u2019 is \nhere omitted.

Curiously, despite the fact that his theory is supported by no \n\n[ 34 ]\n\nevidence and might easily be vitiated by such extraneous circumstances as that the \nprinter\u2019s copy was one or more degrees removed from Bacon\u2019s holograph, or the com- \npositors were exceptional converts to spelling reform, that order is supported by rather \nconclusive evidence which has not apparently been adduced. Jaggard in publishing \nthe first of these editions did not employ either a manuscript or a copy of his own 1612 \nedition but quite obviously used Beale\u2019s 1612 edition and an examination of the three \n1613 editions shows that the \u2018Atturny\u2019 edition, though having the most modern orthog- \nraphy, is the nearest to Beale\u2019s of them allt. \nIt has been customary to regard the editions of the Essays which bear Jaggard\u2019s \nimprint as pirated by him, but there is no evidence whatever to support such a view \nexcept the argumentum ab silentio that Jaggard made no entry for the book in the \nStationers\u2019 Register. There is reason for believing, on the contrary, that despite his \nunsavory reputation Jaggard possessed some rights in this book. This is substantiated \nby the fact that the Essayes were regularly entered to Hooper and to Beale who might \neasily have taken action against Jaggard if he had openly violated their copyrights, \nand yet, despite that fact, Jaggard made no attempt to conceal his connection with \nthese editions, as his brother did in his Shakespeare piracies, by issuing them under \nfalse imprints. Furthermore, though Jaggard himself never made entry for the book, \nhis widow transferred \u2018her estate\u2019 in the copy, 24th February 1626 (Arber IV. 151). In \nsome manner, therefore, Jaggard must have secured \u2018rights\u2019 which the Stationers\u2019 \nCompany regarded as transferable even though not previously entered in the Register. \nBut even if that were proved one must still account for the existence of three editions \nsupposedly published by Jaggard, all dated 1613, but no succeeding editions, except \nHart\u2019s 1614 Edinburgh piracy, until 1624. This, by itself, might be attributed to bad \njudgment upon the part of Jaggard, since the editions before 1613 or after 1624 \nappeared at regularly spaced intervals or at ones otherwise accountable, were it not \nthat the three editions dated 1613 are all obviously designed to appear, at any rate so \nfar as their titles are concerned, identical (see facsimiles in Quaritch Cat. 369). Such \nsimilarity of form might conceivably have been fortuitous, but that seems improbable. \nAn examination of the books themselves serves only to complicate the problem for \nthere can be no doubt whatsoever that, while the edition we have put first (\u2018Atturny\u2019) \nwas printed by William Jaggard for his brother John, the two other editions were both \nprinted by John Beale!{ If Beale printed these editions under some arrangement \n\n{The normal rule of progressive modernization of reprints, except for the relationship with Beale\u2019s edition, \nwould reverse this order so that the \u2018Atturney\u2019 edition would be placed first, for whereas the \u2018Atturney\u2019 \nand \u2018Aturney\u2019 editions are close reprints, if a modernization appears in the \u2018Aturney\u2019 edition it is almost \nalways to be found also in the \u2018Atturny\u2019 edition, etc. \ntHad all three been printed by William Jaggard one might have conjectured that Jaggard had made an \narrangement with Beale whereby he was to be allowed to print one edition after the two, his own and \nBeale\u2019s, 1612 editions were sold. Instead, however, of publishing only one, the simplest hypothesis would \nsuggest that he proceeded to have three printed, one after the other, at intervals from 1613 to say about \n1620, all with similar titles in order to conceal from Beale that the one edition stipulated had long ago \n\nbeen disposed of: \nVOL.I [ 35 ]\n\nmade with Jaggard at the time Beale surrendered his rights in this bookif, a not \nuncommon practice, there would be no reason for issuing all three editions with titles \nobviously intended to appear identical. One is forced, therefore, to conclude that the \ntwo 1613 editions, including the present, printed by Beale are counterfeits, for their \ntext is taken from Jaggard\u2019s 1613 edition and not, as that edition was, from Beale\u2019s \nown 1612. \n\ntfIn 1639, Beale printed and published an edition of the Essays under his own name. His right to the title \nwas disputed and his press taken down, the edition confiscated, and, despite powerful outside interference, \nhe was forced to make submission (see Trans. XV (1934) 371) \n\nS.T.C. 1143. Huntincron C.L., 17.",

In the case of the present edition it may \nbe observed that superficially neither Haviland nor Allott had any title in the copy- \nright}. The registered owners of rights in this title in 1629 were: I. J-Smethwick \n(acquired from Mistress Jaggard, 24 February 1626, see edition of 1613);2. R. Whitaker \n(by original entry, 13 March 1625; these rights transferred 7 March 1653)5 3s J-Parker \n(acquired from Hanna Barret, 3 April 1626, she having been part-owner with Whitaker); \nand 4. John Beale (by original entry, 12 October 1612, in partnership with W.Hall; \nregarding his rights see 1613 edition). Except for these last as likewise Smethwick\u2019s, \nthese rights were all at later times in forcett. \n\ntit is possible that Haviland, either through his uncle Thomas Haviland who had been associated with \nW.Hall, or from his own connection with the preceding edition as printer, and Allott, through his associa- \ntion with Smethwick, may have had some right in the copy. \nttRegarding other unregistered owners see Trans.

The present may be easily distinguished \nby the fact that in it none of the errors listed on p.248 are corrected, whereas in another \neditionf three of the seven (viz. the first, fifth and last) are corrected. The editions are \nlinear duplicates and their differences, though obvious upon juxtaposition, consist \nmainly of typographical variations. We have seen only these two editions but in a \nLeighton Catalogue (N. S. No. X, Lots 94-7) a third is mentioned. It is possible that \nthat variant is either a made-up copy or even one of Dr. Greg\u2019s \u2018printer\u2019s copies\u2019. The \nfact that the copies we have examined do not appear to be \u2018mixed\u2019 seems to indicate \nthat the printing of the various editions was not simultaneous. \nThere has been some recent discussion regarding Bacon\u2019s object in writing this work \nbut no one seems to have recalled the letter{ on the subject which he wrote to Egerton \nsome years before. In it he proposed, as a memorial to Elizabeth more fitting and \npermanent than the statue which James was then contemplating, to write a history of \nEngland. Apparently he was not encouraged as he thought he should or his other \naffairs intervened for this is the only part that was ever completed and, except for the \nfragments posthumously published, apparently all that he ever wrote. Nevertheless, \nfragmentary as this work is, and with all its faults, it has entitled Bacon to be ranked \nwith those other English statesmen-historians, More and Clarendon. \nBacon tells, pp.187-9, of the voyages of \u2018Sebastian Gabato, a Venetian, dwelling in \nBristow\u2019 and of the circumstances that prevented Henry VII from employing Columbus \nin his service. \nPortions of this history have been republished in blank verse by the Shakespeare- \nBacon theorists as the Tragedy of Henry the Seventh. \n\n+Several large and thick-paper copies of that corrected edition are known. They measure some three inches \nmore in height than the small-paper copies, although the formes were not re-imposed. \ntT he original is preserved in the Huntington Library (Ellesmere MS. 128), It was printed in Bacon\u2019s Letters \n1702, No. XVIII, 22-6, in both editions of the Cadala, in Collier\u2019s Bridgewater Cat. and in his Bibl.

As there were at least two editions dated 1622, and one dated 1629, unless \nstill other unrecorded editions were issued, the present is the sixth, instead of the third \nedition, as it is usually described. \nThe copyright in this book was originally shared by Matthew Lownes and William \nBarrett (9 February 1622, Arber IV. 64). Lownes\u2019 part passed to his son, Thomas (10 \nApril 1627, Arber IV. 176) who transferred it to Humphrey Lownes and Robert Young \n(30 May 1627, Arber IV. 180). They, in turn, transferred it to George Cole and George \nLathum (6 November 1628, Arber IV. 205) who later turned it back to Robert Young \n(6 December 1630, Arber IV. 245). Barrett\u2019s widow transferred his share to John \nParker (3 April 1626, Arber IV. 157) who transferred it to John Haviland and John \nWright (4 September 1638, Arber IV. 433). Haviland died before the 20th November \n1638, when his will was proved; his share in the copyright cannot be traced thereafter. \nRobert Young's moiety passed to his son James (22 July 1644, Eyre I, 122) and Richard \nMeighen, who was probably only the agent of the publishers as in the case of the \nJonson folio 1640, died before the 21st March 1642. John Wright\u2019s share presumably \npassed to his son, but there is no record of transfer. It is therefore not possible to \nidentify the holder of Barrett\u2019s share at the time of publication of this edition. \nThe printing of this edition was divided between two shops, as is evident from dif- \nferences in the type, paper, and headlines. The dichotomy occurred after quire R. The \nprinter of the first part, from the ornaments, was Richard Hodgkinson, while the other \nsection, though it contains no ornaments, may be attributed to Robert Young on the \nstrength of the initials in the imprint and his known share in the copyright. \n\nTA copy was in the possession of Thorpe in 1931, \n\n[ 40 ]\n\n34 \n\nBACON, Sir FRANCcIs, VISCOUNT ST.

A very few copies have appended two leaves of \nErrata, signed \u201c\u20ac\u2019, following Sig Hhh; such copies were probably of the latest sold \nthough only by chance of any particular temporal order of printing. A few copies were \napparently printed on large-paper being more than an inch taller than the present, e.g. \nthe Scott-Heber-Britwell copy now Dr. Rosenbach\u2019s, the Hoe, I.Casaubon-Orford- \nHalsey-Huntington, and Col. Sotheby-?Prescott copies. \nMr.F.S.Ferguson has noted that in the lower margin of verso [Rr4] of the Steeves- \nR.L.Redmond copy is printed the following couplet: \u2018To pleasure and please you, our \nsleep hath been broken: Now if our Worke like you, vouchsafe vs a token.\u2019 Query if \nthis was a note to Bacon from the printer intended only for the proof but preserved \nin a \u2018printer\u2019s copy\u2019. \nThe attribution of this book to the press of Thomas Purfootf is very doubtful. The \nfactotum which occurs here is similar but not identical with one he used. It seems to \nbe the same as that used by Thomas Creede} in Breton\u2019s Mothers blessing, 1602 [q.v.]. \nFrom the evidence of the type, signatures and headlines it appears that the text was \ndivided among three compositors. The first set-up Book I and sheets Kk-Rr of Book \nII; the second set-up sheets Aa-Ii and Eee-Hhh; while the third set sheets Ss-Ddd. \nThis book occurs more frequently than most of Bacon\u2019s early editions, twenty-five \ncopies at least can be located and many more are recorded; nevertheless, it is intrinsi- \ncally an important book. \n\n}The initial T, with dolphins, is one of which several castings as well as more or less accurate copies are \nknown. Purfoot employed one of the castings of this initial. \ntA corrected proof of the inner forme of sheet G belongs to Roland L. Redmond of New York. In an early \nbold hand it has written in the margin \u2018Creed\u2019. \n\nS.T.C. 1164. ARBER III. 299; 301. Huntincton C.L.,15.  Hazuirr,23. Ho Car. I \n(1903) 29.

An edition of it was \namong the books Laneham found in Captain Coxe\u2019s library. \nIn the present edition the Balade of our Lady which concluded the 1509 edition is \nomitted, while the verses excusing the rudeness of the translation are transposed from \nthe beginning to the end. \nThe present is of considerable interest and value because of the Eg/ogues\u00a7 ap- \npended, the original editions of which are exceedingly rare.

With bookplate, signature (Sig if) and notes (pasted in at end) of Joseph Ames, \nthe antiquarian and bibliographer; and signature of Barrett of Lee Priory. \n\nTue ascription of this book to William Roy or to William (?alias Jerome) Barlow or \nto both has been frequently discussed but the matter appears to have been settled by \nA.Koszul (R.E.S. IV, 25 ff.). On the other hand, that this work is to be identified with \n\u2018the treatyse of the buryall of the masse\u2019 mentioned in a manuscript recantation by \nBishop Barlow has not been questioned. \nThat this satire against Wolsey was printed by Schott can be established from the \nevidence of the ornaments and type (Proctor-Schott No.6 with a new lower case \u2018h\u2019). \nBut there is also external evidence in the form of a deposition which Schott made before \nthe Senate at Frankfort when he declared that he had printed a thousand copies of \nthis book, and a thousand of another (S.T.C. 6813, possibly also by Barlow); that he \nwas not paid for his work but being left with the books in his hands he pawned them \nto the Frankfort Jews, from whom they were bought in order to be destroyed by a \nHermann Rinck, the agent of Cardinal Wolsey. According to Rinck (Trans. XI (1909) \n182) it was intended that these books should be \u2018enclosed and hidden in paper covers, \npacked in ten bundles covered with linen and conveyed in time by sea craftily and \nwithout exciting any suspicion to Scotland or England where they would have been \nsold only as blank paper.\u2019 \nWith the second edition, which was printed at London, 1546, by Richard Jugge under \nthe pseudonym of Henry Nicholson of Wesel, Bishop Barlow probably had nothing to \ndo. It was reprinted in order to attack the mid-century Catholic reaction and for that \nreason was considerably altered so that it became, instead of an attack upon Wolsey, a \nwholesale denunciation of the \u2018papistical\u2019 clergy, even the references to Henry\u2019s divorce \nfrom Catherine of Arragon being omitted. The second edition contains a new preface \nand there are other changes, e.g. on account of the death of Pope Clement VII, 1534, \nthe third line of verso [i8] in the first edition which refers specifically to him, is made \nto refer in the second edition to Popes in general. \nThis book was several times condemned by proclamation and denunciation (Trans. \n\nXI (1909) 214). \nCopies of this first edition are not nearly as rare as has been stated for seven other \n\ntJoseph Ames usually marked his books by writing his name or the initial of his surname after the signature \nlor J. This practice was imitated, mutatis mutandis, by Philip Bliss and others. \n\nVOL.I [ 49 ]\n\ncopies can be located and at least five more are recorded in the auction records.

An unwashed, fresh copy. \n\nTue importance of this book consists solely in the fact that it is believed to have been \nthe one during the printing of which Caxton was initiated into the \u2018mystery\u2019 of that \nart. The evidence for this belief is to be found in a statement by Wynken de Worde, \nCaxton\u2019s assistant, in his prologue to the English edition of De proprietatibus rerum, \n1495, where he refers to \u2018William Caxton firft prjter of this boke In laten tonge at \nColeyn hyfelf to auaiice . . . \u2019. The present edition appears to be the one to which \nde Worde alluded for it is printed in types attributed to an anonymous printer of \nCologne generally called, not very happily, \u2018The Printer of Flores Sancti Augustini\u2019 \nwho was at work circa 1472-3. Caxton is knownf to have resided in Cologne at least \nfrom the 17th July 1471 till towards the end of 1472, and therefore the probability that \nhe either observed or assisted in the printing of this book is now accepted as very well \nestablished.t \nDe Worde refers to this as the first edition but the editors of the Gesamtkatalog have \nplaced it second. For a prior position they have elected an undated edition by Berthold \nRuppel of Basel which they date 1470, but which the British Museum authorities, on \nthe evidence of the type, place in the eighties. \n\n}The entries in the Register of Aliens of Cologne proving this were published by Walter Stein in 1907, but \ntheir importance was first pointed out by Colonel Birch who came upon them independently, Trans. IV \n\n(1923) 50. \ntlt has been suggested that an edition of Walter Burley\u2019s De vita et moribus philosophorum, also printed by \nthis same printer in the same type, may have some Caxton connection as it is the only other book by an \n\nEnglish author from this press.

But such a date \nseems to our eye much too late, unless of course, the circumstance that most of the \nornaments and much of type is the same in both the second and the third editions is \nnot accidental but due to the fact that the latter was a conscious counterfeit of the \nsecond edition}. So far as can be determined there is no evidence, other than internal, \nthat may be adduced to show that both editions were not published, as their imprints \ntestify, in 1635. But if one of them was not printed then, a date nearer 1640 than 1650 \nmay be conjectured and the counterfeit explained as follows: the original publisher, \nWalter Burre, made no entry for it in the Stationers\u2019 Register nor was it transferred \nwith his other copyrights when his widow sold the business to John Spencer in 1630. \nNevertheless, it is likely that the rights, though unregistered were honestly acquired \nby Spencer}} and the second edition, published by him, is quite legitimate. Spencer, \nupon his appointment as Library Keeper of Sion College in 1630, gradually dropped \nhis connections with bookselling and it may be that Nicholas Okes who had printed the \nfirst two editions considered that if he closely imitated the edition printed for Spencer \nin 1635, he could escape detection. \nThe prologue which was not included in the first edition is merely the Blackfriars \nprologue of Lyly\u2019s Sapho and Phao, slightly altered. Scholars are not agreed as to \nwhether this play may be attributed, in whole or in part, to either or both Beaumont \nand Fletcher.

Such a date, it may \nbe said, has some plausibility from the circumstance that a market for it might have been created by the \npublication in 1647 of the folio edition of the hitherto unpublished Beaumont and Fletcher plays. \nfin 1635 these materials belonged to Nicholas Okes, but in 1650 they had passed to William Wilson, the \nsuccessor to the business on the retirement of John Okes and his widow in 1644. \nHOf the nine titles which the Widow Burre transferred to him, 3 July 1630 (Arber IV.238), four were not \nreprinted separately, two were claimed by Stansby by reason of a prior-dated transfer in the hand of \nWalter Burre, two were assigned to other publishers, and only one, Middleton\u2019s Mad World My Masters, \nwas published by Spencer, and that one (the second edition, 1640) was sold by an agent which probably \nindicates that Spencer had by that time given up retail bookselling. \nIn any case, by 1661, William Wilson acquired, presumably legitimately, sufficient title in the book \nto transfer it to Mrs. Anne Moseley, \u00a7 August 1661 (Eyre II, gor). \n\nS.T.C. 16754.

As several sections have no ornamental blocks it is not possible to identify their \nprinters. The preliminaries, as Moseley states, were divided among several printers \n\u2018for expedition\u2019. These printers were: quire A, William Wilson; quire a, Edward Griffin \nII; quire b, Thomas Warren; quire c, Susan Islip; quires d and e, unidentifiable but \npossibly by one printer; quire f, Wilson; and quire g, Griffin. Of the eight sections of \nthe text, the first was printed by Warren; the second by Wilson; the third by Susan \nIslip; the fourth by Ruth Raworth; the fifth by Griffin; while the sixth to eighth, except \nfor quire 8*D which was printed by Griffin, have no blocks but one or more of their \nprinters may have printed quires d and e of the preliminaries. \n\nThe address by Moseley has been transcribed by J.C.Reed in Oxford Bibliographical \nSoc.

Of these plays ten} were apparently the property of \nHumphrey Moseley or of his widow Anne. He also owned a half-interest in the plays \nprinted in the 1647 collected edition. The other half belonged to Humphrey Robinson. \nThat latter share was transferred to John Martyn and Henry Herringman, 30 January \n1673, but no transfer is recorded of Moseley\u2019s rights. Of the eight other plays threett \nbelonged to Andrew Crooke, who died in 1674, three\u00a7 to William Leake who though \nhe did not die until 1681, was not very active after 1660; while of the two remaining, \nonefa belonged to Gabriell Bedell and Thomas Collins and the other{a to Leonard \nLichfield. The owners of the last two plays were either alive or had representatives \nactive in 1679. \nThe manner in which the publishers, Martyn, Herringman, and Marriot, acquired \n\n{The last half of this volume was printed by Hills. \nMoseley published editions of the Elder Brother, Thierry, Woman Hater, Scornful Lady and Wild-Goose \nChase. He entered Cupid\u2019 s Revenge and Anne Moseley entered Knight of the Burning Pestle and Rollo. He \nalso advertised in his play-lists Monsieur Thomas and Two Noble Kinsmen which had been the property \nof Simon Waterson. \nE{Coronation, Night Walker, and Wit without Money. \n\u00a7King and No King, Maid\u2019s Tragedy, and Phylaster. \nfaFaithful Shepherdess. \njaRule a Wife and Have a Wife. \n\nVOL.I [ 61 ]\n\nthe rights to the plays included in this volume will probably never be known from \ndirect evidence. We may, however, speculate upon it with some confidence. In the first \nplace, Martyn\u2019s interest apparently was limited to a quarter-share in the copyright of \nthe plays in the 1647 volume for that is all that his widow transferred to Robert Scott, \n21 August 1683 (Eyre III, 182). Furthermore, Marriot published, 1678, an edition of \nthe Elder Brother, a play formerly Humphrey Moseley\u2019s. Now Moseley\u2019s widow, who \ndied in 1673, had at intervals registered the transfer of a considerable number of her \nhusband\u2019s copyrights but none of his Beaumont and Fletcher titles. It is possible that \nwhen she died they were still in her possession. But the fact that Marriot, in 1678, \npublished one of the plays is at least presumptive evidence that by that time he, prob- \nably in partnership with Herringman, had acquired all of the Moseley copyrights in \nthese plays. Also it is probable that he, alone or with Herringman, had picked up the \nothers from the heirs of Crooke, from Leake and from Collins (with the last, Marriot \nwas at one time associated). It is possible that Lichfield\u2019s play Rule a Wife was con- \nsidered a derelict as it had never been entered in the Registers. \nThe booksellers\u2019 Address is of considerable interest as it records the source of the \nadditions and corrections introduced into the present. According to their story they \nobtained from a \u2018Gentleman\u2019, a contemporary of the authors, a corrected copy of the \n1647 edition to which were added the prologues, epilogues, and dramatis personae. It \nwould be of considerable importance in forming judgments concerning the textual \nalterations in this volume to identify that \u2018Gentleman\u2019. \n\nHazurr I, 31. W.A.Cuark Car. I, 8.",

No copy is known of the first issue in original condition which \nhas this quarter-sheet inserted. \nThese two leaves, as Mr.F.S.Ferguson discovered, are found in two settings with \nvariant spellings. Apparently they were set-up together as a half-sheet for convenience \nin printing. In the following table the readings of the present copy are in the first \ncolumn. \n\nTo the Vniuersitie of Oxenford To the Vniuersitie of Cambridge \nLine 3 breed, breed Line 8 hir Nimphs _ her Nymphs \n& foorde, foord, II Feasting Feafting \na back backe 2, then than \n10 doth dooth 13 Whil\u2019st Whil\u2019ft \n\nThe reason for the cancellation of Sig A3-6 was first noted by Charles Crawford \n(The Sh. Allusion Book YI (1909) App. D). It is, briefly, that the statements which the \naddress contains are inaccurate and misleading when applied to the book as it was \npublished. The discrepancy arose because the notes from which this volume was printed \nwere originally gathered by Bodenham and included many which never appeared in \nprint. These materials Bodenham turned over to a poetaster who signed himself \u2018A.M.\u2019, \nand who may have been Anthony Munday, with permission to use them according to \nthe plan which is sketched out in the address and The Conclusion. Bodenham\u2019s patron- \nage of this sort of compilation is well known but in this case he seems to have been \nunfortunate in his choice of editor for \u2018A.M.\u2019 omitted author\u2019s names, altered quota- \ntions to suit his purpose, omitted altogether the quotations of several of the authors \n\n}Traces of verse are still preserved. See Lidrary VII (1916) 150. \n\nVOL.I [ 65 ]\n\nwho are named in the address, and added many others from authors whose names are \nnot listed there. Altogether, one may easily sympathize with Bodenham\u2019s disgust and \ninsistance that the address should be deleted. \nOf the 4482 extracts included in this book Professor Crawford has identified about \n3000, of which 213 are from Shakespeare. Further study would doubtless serve to \nidentify a larger proportion of the quotations and perhaps would not be without its \nreward in information regarding the date of composition of works not printed until \nafter 1600 (see N. & Q, 10S. X, 206). Prof. Crawford has also discovered that some \n800 passages here given in verse have been manufactured from prose sources such as \nWits Commonwealth and the works of Lyly, Sidney, and Primaudaye. \n\nS.T.C. 3189.

The title and first two leaves of dedica- \ntion are in Harris facsimile. Sig [06] and [TT6], both blanks, are lacking, as is also the map some- \ntimes found at the end of the Pentateuch but it is doubtful if it was issued with all copies. \n\nTue first issue contains only four preliminary leaves all printed in the same Schwa- \nbacher type as the text and presumably printed at the same press as the rest of the \nBible. The title transcribed above is from the Harris facsimile of that issue wrongly \ninserted in the present copy. The verso should contain \u2018The bokes of the whole Byble\u2019 \nwhich continues on the recto of the second leaf. Coverdale\u2019s Prologue occupies the verso \nof the second to the recto of the fourth and on the verso of the latter are the contents \nof Genesis. The Earl of Leicester\u2019s copy at Holkham, a first issue, contains the title and \none preliminary leaf and is the only example known except a fragment in the British \nMuseum. \nThe present copy, from the evidence of the preliminary leaves, belongs to a later \nissue than the first but the means of distinguishing these later issues occurs in the title- \nleaf which is lacking in the present. \nThe second and later issues of the preliminaries are believed to have been printed in \nEngland probably by John Nycholson who is known to have had the blocks in 1537. \nThese issues have eight preliminary leavest{q all printed in English black-letter and \ndiffering only in the first leaf. The second issue, of which the copy belonging to the \nMarquess of Northampton at Castle Ashby is the only one known, omits the phrase \n\n\u00a7As in Part II, but the corner blocks represent Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel\u2019s vision, and Daniel in the lions\u2019 \nden. \n\nf@As in Part II, but the corner blocks represent a priest reading the Law, the return to Jerusalem, the \nsortie after the death of Holophernes, and the storming of a city. \n\ntalncluding the two side-pieces as before, with the Evangelists in the corners, Christ triumphing in middle \nat top and St. John the Baptist in middle at bottom. \nHaThe added matter is the dedication to Henry VIII. \n\n[ 68 |\n\n\u2018and truly tranflated out of Douche and Latyn\u2019 and concludes the quotation from \nJoshua; the verso is blank. The third issue of which a copy is in the Cambridge Uni- \nversity Library and another was sold by Quaritch in 1900, is said to have the title from \nthe same setting as the second issue\u00a7 but on the verso is a prayer by Nicholas \nShaxton, Bishop of Salisbury. The fourth issue title occurs in the Jersey-Carysfort copy \nas well as one preserved in Gloucester Cathedral. It reads very much as the earlier ones \nbut is dated 1536. \nCoverdale\u2019s version, besides being the first complete English translation of the Bible \nto be printed, is still of considerable importance not only because of its influence upon \nlater revisions but also because his translation of the Psalms was adopted for the \nEdwardian Book of Common Prayer and to this day continues to be appended thereto. \nThis text is therefore the one most familiar to countless Englishmen and communicants \nof the Church of England. \nOver forty copies have been preserved not one of which is entirely complete. The \npresent from its size and general cleanness may be justly considered a very fine copy. \n\n\u00a7aFrom printed transcripts (both made from facsimiles) it would appear that there are variants in the \nsecond issue title for the Bible Society catalogue spells \u2018Scrypture\u2019 thus in the third line while the Rylands \nspells it \u2018Scripture\u2019. \n\nS.T.C. 2063.

By \nIohn | Frederick{z Stam, dwelling by the | South-Church, at the figne of the Hope, | \n1633 |\u2019, indicates that since the cuts and initials are the same that this edition was \nalso printed by Stam at Amsterdam. The state of the blocks is so very nearly the same \nin both editions that one cannot venture to date the present by that means. \nThe text used for these \u20181599\u2019 editions appears to be the 1610 or 1611 quarto editions \npublished by Barker in London, at any rate the cuts are copies of the ones first used in \nthose editions. \nProfessor Pollard suggests that the reason these editions were printed in the Low \nCountries for surreptitious importation into England was that after 1616 the printing \nof the Geneva version in England was subject to a \u2018silent boycott\u2019 but that Robert \nBarker may have found himselfft \u201calways in the position of having \u2018a few remaining \ncopies\u2019 of one or other of these editions in stock.\u201d The connection of the Barkers with \nWalsingham and consequently their probable Puritan leanings is well known. How- \never, it is probable that the boycott was not entirely \u2018silent\u2019 for in the unpublished \nStationers\u2019 Court Book C 39\u00b0 a \u2018direction\u2019 of the Archbishop of Canterbury was read to \nthe Court, 3rd October 1613, \u2018that no more bibles be bound vp and sold wthout the \nApocripha in them upon pain of one whole yeares Imprisonment.\u2019 Again, 2 March 1618 \n(Court Book C 504) \u2018my lo. Bishoppe of london\u2019s pleasure\u2019 was read to the court \u2018that \nall the Bibles w\u2018out Apocripha be deliured to mf Phillip Kinge\u2019. As none of the quarto \n\ni The Rev. Nicholas Pocock suggested (The Bibliographer III (1882) 106) that Barker imported these edi- \ntions and \u2018affixed [titles with] the date 1599, probably because this was a well-known and popular edition.\u201d \nSuch an explanation, however, is impossible because the title-leaf is conjugate and the title-compartment \nin these editions is a copy of Barker's and undoubtedly as foreign as the text, \nHThe selection of that particular false date and imprint Prof. Pollard suggests (Records pp.73-4) was due \n\nto the fact that that year was the latest to which Christopher Barker\u2019s name could be affixed, as in 1600 \nRobert took over his father\u2019s business. \n\n[ 70]\n\n\u20181599\u2019 editions of this Geneva Version included the Apocrypha it is not unlikely that \nthese orders were directed against them\u00a7. \nAt the Hampton Court Conference James declared his dislike of the marginal notes \nof the Genevan Bible and called it \u2018very partiall, untrue, seditious, and savouring too \nmuch of dangerous and traiterous conceits\u2019. However, editions of that version con- \ntinued to be issued by the King\u2019s Printer until 1616, apparently without any hindrance. \nThereafter, according to Prynne Canterburies Doome 1646, p.181, \u2018our Printers have \nneglected to reprint them for feare of hindering the sale of Bibles of the last Translation \nwithout Notes [i.e. Royal Version], they have been sold without contradiction till this \nArchbishop [Laud] began to domineire; yet no sooner was he advanced to his Papall \nSee, but the printing, importing and sale of all these Bibles with Notes was most \nstrictly inhibited, the Bibles searched for, seized, confiscated, the importers and Sellers \nof them imprisoned, vexed, and some of them ruined in the High Commission Court\u2019. \nIn his diary (The History of the Troubles and Tryal of Laud 1695, p.350) Archbishop \nLaud admitted that he sought to prevent the importation of foreign printed editions \nof this translation but protested that he did it to protect the English printing tradeta. \nHe does not comment upon the charge that he prevented the printing of Geneva \nBibles in England though there can be no doubt that under the 1637 Star-Chamber \nDecree he had the right to review the licenses of reprints. \nDoubtless, the motives of all parties concerned were mixed, but the fact that the \nefforts to prevent the importation of Geneva Bibles were made by the ecclesiastical \nauthorities rather than by the King\u2019s Printer, at least so far as we can find record, \nwould seem to indicate that the matter was more doctrinal than commercial. \n\u00a7For notes on the omission of the Apocrypha in English printed Bibles, see Nos.61 and 64. \njaAccording to Prynne, op. cit., Sir William Boswell wrote Laud, 30 September 1633, that two editions of \n\u2018English Bibles with the Geneva Notes\u2019 were being printed at Delft and Amsterdam and would be \u2018trans- \nported under pretence of White-paper\u2019, etc. \n\nS.T.C. 2174.",

This plate, Boel\u2019s sole English title-page, is very well engraved but rare in \nfine condition. It occurs in two states. In one, reproduced by Johnson, the vowel signs in the \nTetragrammaton are to the left of the \u2018wav\u2019 (third letter from right), the fifth line ends with a \n\n  \n\nVOL.I [71]\n\nperiod, and the first \u2018h\u2019 in \u2018Churches\u2019 in the tenth line looks more like a \u2018b\u2019; in the other, e.g. the \npresent, the vowel signs are belowt the \u2018wav\u2019, the fifth line ends with a colon, and the \u2018b\u2019 in \n\u2018Churches\u2019 appears to have been altered. From the corrections it appears that the present state \nis the later. \nThe engraved map of Canaan, inner forme of sheet D1-2, drawn by John Speed after Dr. John \nMore, dated 1611, is Fry No.14; the index on reverse is Fry No.20.

The statement \u2018Appointed \nto be read in Churches\u2019 which appears on both titles of this edition as well as on the titles of many, though \nby no means of all early reprints, does not mean \u2018Authorized\u2019 but, as pointed out in the preliminary \nmatter, simply how the Scriptures were pointed out or \u2018appointed\u2019 for public reading. This \u2018Appointment\u2019 \nwas later transferred to the Prayer-Book and left out of the Bibles although the phrase was retained on \nthe title long afterwards, In many editions of the Bishops\u2019 Bible which this version superseded the title \nstated that it was \u2018Authorised and Appointed to be read in Churches\u2019.

        "text": "Enoraveb Trrir, Roya Version (\u2018He\u2019 BrBte) 1611 (REDUCED). No. 61\n\nma\n\nreading in Ruth HIL.15. That reading was repeated in a whole series of Bibles, in folio, \nquarto, and octavo, printed and dated 1611 to 1640, just as was another similar series \nwhich has the reading \u2018She\u2019 in the above passage and is derived originally from the \nsecond edition of the Royal version, dated 1611, and known as the \u2018She\u2019 Bible. The \npriority of the present edition was first firmly established by the Rev. W.E.Smith, \nVicar of Corton, in 4 Study of the Great \u2018She\u2019 Bible (reprinted from The Library January, \nMarch, and April 1890) who based his conclusions upon bibliographical rather than \ntextual evidence. There are stil! some questions unsettled regarding the composition \nand printing of this great version which is perhaps the most important single influence \nupon the development of English prose style. They may be found discussed at great \nlength in Lovett\u2019s The English Bible in the \u00a5.Rylands Library, 1899, and in the works \nthere cited. \nThere were five other editions in folio which are paginary reprints of this first edition \nand copies are usually found, upon examination, to be made-up, generally at a more \nor less recent date, with leaves from some other edition. In fact any copy in a nineteenth \ncentury binding or which by any chance has passed through the hands of either Lea \nWilson or Francis Fry may be suspected of sophistication. Though perhaps half a dozen \ncomplete copies might be found in private hands it may well be doubted if any copy \nknown surpasses the present in unimpeachable splendor. \nIn their report, 16 November 1618, to the Synod of Dort on the making of this ver- \nsion (Pollard Records pp.336-9) the English theologians stated that it was part of King \nJames's plan that a complete Genealogy and Map of the Holy Land should be appended. \nIn October 1611, John Speed obtained a privilege for ten years from James that his \nGenealogies and Map of Canaan should be sold with every copy of the Bible. He engaged \nto supply the stationers with various sizes at prices ranging from sixpence to two shil- \nlings a copy. His privilege was renewed several times until, in 1638, he sold his stock \nand rights to the Stationers\u2019 Company for \u00a3700. From the unpublished records of the \nStationers it appears that the decorative borders and panels with which the Genealo- \ngies were printed as well as the plates for the Map were Speed\u2019s property and that he \nemployed William Hall and John Beale (from the ornaments in the present edition), \nlater Beale alone (from records of a dispute which Speed had with him, 20 August 1623, \nCourt Book C 78>), and, finally, John Dawson (from ornaments found in later editions) \nto print the Genealogies. As Speed sold his stock to the Stationers\u2019 Company in whole- \nsale lots while booksellers obtained their copies of the Bible from the King\u2019s Printer \nand the Genealogies from the Company's warehouse it is not at all remarkable that \ncopies of this first edition occur with variant settings of the Genealogies. \nThe separate binding of the Apocrypha in this copy is of more than passing interest. \nAt the Synod of Dort in 1618 the Puritan party made a strong though unsuccessful \neffort to remove the Apocrypha from the Bible. In England the opposition came espe- \ncially from the Presbyterians and took final form in the Westminster Confession, 1648: \n\u2018The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration are no part \nof the Canon of the Scripture and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, \n\nVOL.I {73 ]\n\n61A \n\nnor to be in any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings\u2019. The \nprogress of this exclusion may be traced in the records of the various Conferences from \nthe Hampton Court (1603) to the Savoy (1668), but for our purpose a survey of the \neffect upon the Bibles published during the seventeenth century is perhaps of more \nimmediate interest\u00a7. Occasional copies of the Royal Version in various sizes before 1648 \noccur with the Apocrypha cut out but no edition, other than the duodecimo ones dis- \ncussed in No.64, was apparently published without it. In 1648, a quarto edition was \nprinted in which the Apocrypha was not required by the signatures, although still \nretained in the list of books. Thereafter it was omitted in an increasing proportion of \neditions until, towards the end of the seventeenth century, very few editions, even in \nfolio, contain it. In Scotland apparently the feeling was stronger than in England for \nArchbishop Laud so far recognized its existence as to reduce the public use of the \nApocrypha to six lessons for Saints\u2019 days when preparing his ill-fated Scottish Booke of \nCommon Prayer 1637. \nIt is therefore not surprising that this copy which was bound probably about 1690 \nhas had the Apocrypha removed. But it is remarkable that so choleric a person as \nAndrew Fletcher (he killed more than one man in anger) should have preserved that \nportion which he would not admit to the honour of full morocco\u2014perhaps he there \nshowed himself a true Scot. \nThough it may be heresy to suggest it, there is some reason for doubting if the wood- \ncut general-title was ever originally issued with the first \u2018He\u2019 Bible. The proper title is \nunquestionably the engraved one by Boel, reproduced by Fry in original size. However, \nthe woodcut title is found in a few otherwise unexceptionable copies and all authorities \nappear to accept it as genuine. Nevertheless, if it was originally so issued then it is \nnecessary that several apparently contradictory phenomena should be explained. In \nthe first place, the letterpress which is found in those titles is from the identical setting \nwhich occurs in the earliest edition of the \u2018She\u2019 Bible, whereas the leaf conjugate with \nthe title in the first \u2018He\u2019 Bible is Sig [A6] while in the first \u2018She\u2019 Bible it is Sig [Aq]. No \nother leaves, except sheets S1-6 and V3-4 of the New Testament, are identical in the \ntwo editions. Furthermore, as an anonymous writer in the Athenaeum (20 September \n1884) pointed out, there is no real evidence that the woodcut compartment was actually \nprepared before the copperplate, although it is generally asserted that the woodcut was \nemployed because Boel\u2019s plate was not yet ready. \n\n\u00a7Regarding the omission of the Apocrypha from some editions of the Geneva Bible, see No.60. \n\nS.T.C, 2216.

It is doubtful if these sheets, 1i3-4, Kkk3-4, 411-6, 453-4, are not properly to be \nfound in copies of the \u2018B\u2019 text. Certainly they occur there as frequently as not. Likewise sheet \nS1-6, and V3-4 of the New Testament are from the same setting in this copy as in the first edition \nof the \u2018He\u2019 Bible which is as should be in the \u2018B\u2019 text. With the exception of the title, this is a \nfine and very large copy. \n\nTue present is the second edition of the \u2018Royal\u2019 Version, first edition of the so-called \n\u2018She\u2019 series, sometimes called the \u2018Great She Bible\u2019. This is the issue without the \n\u2018reprint\u2019 leaves. There are several unexplained features of this edition which will prob- \nably always continue to puzzle bibliographers. In the first place, copies are usually \nfound with a general-title dated 1613. Such copies have, as a rule, a number of sheets\u2014 \nusually about a third of the volume, the highest number recorded being about 128 \nsheets\u2014from a different and apparently later setting. Fry distinguished these variant \nsheets in his elaborate monograph but his classification is very arbitrary. W.E.Smith, \non the other hand, basing his tests not only upon bibliographical minutiae which he \nobserved in the variant settings themselves but also upon the conformity of some \nthirty copies, has establishedt a much more satisfactory standard. The original setting \nhe designates the \u2018B\u2019 text, and the posterior setting, the \u2018C\u2019. As will be seen from the \nnotes above, the present copy is almost entirely of the \u2018B\u2019 text, in fact except for the \ntitle and follower this is an unusually pure example. \nWhat accident led to the reprinting of so large a proportion of this edition or what \ncircumstances caused so many copies of it to be withheld for three years can now only \nbe conjectured. \nIn this edition there is a remarkable error in Matthew XXVI_36, \u2018Judas\u2019 appearing \nfor \u2018Jesus\u2019. Sometimes a correction slip is pasted over the mistake but in the present \ncopy it is corrected in an early hand.

Sheet B1-4 is from the 1617 edition while \nsheet B2-3 is Fry\u2019s 1613 \u2018variant\u2019. Quires C and D are both of the 1611 \u2018She\u2019 setting, Speed\u2019s \nGenealogies is Fry No.6, and the Map is from Elstrack\u2019s plate, Fry No.13 with Fry\u2019s letterpress \nNo.18. The text is an exceptionally pure example of Smith\u2019s \u2018C\u2019 text with reprints. It resembles \nvery closely a copy now in the British Museum (gos. g 11.) and has only twelve sheets not in \nthe posterior state. The sheets not in reprinted state are: X2, Ii3, the whole of quire Pp, sheets \nBbbr, Eeer, Lll2-3, 4X2, and in the New Testament, sheets St and V3. The reprinted states of \nBbbr, 4X2, St and V3 are very rare while it is doubtful if the state of sheet Eeet which occurs \nin the present copy is not the correct one for this issue. \n\nTurs is the first edition, with \u2018reprints\u2019, of the \u2018She\u2019 Bible, Smith\u2019s \u2018C\u2019 text. Regarding \nthe duplicate printing of 128 sheets of this edition see preceding number. No absolutely \npure \u2018C\u2019 text copy, that is with the later state of every sheet of which duplicate settings \nhave been distinguished, is known. The present approaches, except for the preliminary \nJeaves, the most typical copies examined by Fry or Smith. The preliminary leaves, \nexcept for the title, may have been originally so issued as several other copies have \nbeen discovered mixed in that way. \n\nS.T.C. 2224. Dartow anp Move | No.246.",

It is doubtful if the \u00a2pocrypha, though included in the list of \nbooks, was printed for this edition. It is lacking in the three copies (British Museum, \nHarvard, and present) we have examined, and apparently is likewise lacking in all \nother copies of which there is record. The British and Foreign Bible Society has ten \nduodecimo editions of earlier date than the present in all of which the Apocrypha is \nlacking though mentioned in the list of \u2018Bookes\u2019. This deficiency probably is due to the \nfact that these duodecimo editions were published for sale mainly by the haberdashers \nat the Royal Exchange who clothed them in embroidered bindings like the present and \nwho perhaps specified that the Apocrypha should be omitted in order that the books \nwhen bound should not be too bulky. Copies of earlier editions of the Royal Version in \nother sizes are known which lack the Apocrypha (cut out presumably for doctrinal \nreasons, see No.61) but no earlier edition of larger size can be traced in which that \nportion is omitted in all copies recorded. \n\nS.T.C, 2319.",

It is a reprint of Pynson\u2019s second edition, 1527, and although bibliographers \nunanimously place it later than the Tottel edition there is some reason to believe that \nit precedes itt. The fact that Wayland\u2019s patent included the sole right to the printing \nfor seven years of such books as he should first print probably would have no force as \n\n{See Hodnet No.2049. This block was used by Verard in his Grandes Heures 1489. \n{The date of publication of this edition can be determined roughly within a period of some eighteen or \ntwenty months as follows. On the verso of the separate title, Sig [Gga], found in several copies, see note \nbelow, Wayland printed the patent which he received from Mary, 24th October 1553, which provides a \nterminus, while Hazlitt records a copy bearing in an early hand a note stating that it was purchased in \n1555, which may provide a date ante quam. This is corroborated by Baldwin\u2019s reference to the suppression \nof Wayland\u2019s edition of the Mirror for Magistrates in his address in the 1559 edition of that work as having \noccurred \u2018iii yeares agoe\u2019. But since it is impossible to tell whether Baldwin was accurate or whether he \nwas writing some time before the 1559 edition was printed or even in what part of the year that edition \nwas produced, the question of the priority of these two editions cannot be settled by this evidence. It may \nbe observed, however, that the dated product of Wayland\u2019s press in 1554 is very meager as compared with \nthat of 1555 and that, other things being equal, it is more likely that during the lean period when Wayland \n\nwas awaiting the copy for the Primer of 1555, he produced this volume. For another view, see Prof.L.B. \nCampbell Huntington Bulletin No.6. \n\n[ 86 ]\n\nregards this book for neither Tottel nor Wayland was the first printer of ittf. However, \nit is difficult to believe that Wayland would publish a reprint of Pynson\u2019s corrupt text \nto compete with Tottel\u2019s corrected and much superior one and therefore, particularly \nas nowhere in his garrulous notes does he mention Tottel\u2019s edition, it would seem \nlikely that this by Wayland was at least in the press before Tottel\u2019s edition was \npublished. \nWayland was not content with reprinting Pynson\u2019s text of the Lydgate translation \nbut conceived, according to the story William Baldwin relates\u00a7, the idea of supple- \nmenting that work with a series of \u2018tragedies\u2019 of English men and women which after- \nwards formed the nucleus of the Mirror for Magistrates. He not only conceived the idea \nbut apparently actually carried it out for the copy of the present work in the Dyce \ncollection has a general-title which refers specifically to that continuationta. Moreover, \nseveral copies{a of this book have printed on recto [Ggq] a separate title which reads \n\u2018fin same compartment as general-title] @ memorial [in Fraktur] | of tuche Princes, as \n{ince | the tyme of King Richard | the feconde, haue been | wnfortunate in the | Realme of | Eng- \nlanv. | (2) | LONDINI | In edibus Johannis Waylandi. | cum priuilegio per Sep | \ntennium. |\u2019. And, finally, in the British Museum are preserved two duplicate leaves, \ncontaining part of the legend of Owen Glendower with headline reading \u2018A briefe \nmemorial of Unfortunate Englysh princes.\u2019tta which obviously belong to this edition \nof Wayland\u2019s. \nWhether Wayland actually completed the publication of this edition or whether he \nwas forced by the authorities to desist before it was entirely set-up can only be finally \ndetermined by the discovery of a complete copy$\u00ab. The separate title for the later \nportion is usually described as a \u2018trial-title\u2019 but, obviously, if that was its nature it \nwould not have been printed as an integral part of sheet G1-4. Also, the fact that Way- \nland mentioned this continuation in the (Dyce copy) general-title, which, presumably, \nwas not set-up until the rest of the book was completed, inclines one to believe that the \nprohibition came after the book was ready for publication{\u00e9. \n\ntt\u2019The same is true of the editions of Hawes\u2019 Pastime of Pleasure which were issued by Wayland in 1554, and \nby Tottel in 1555. \n\u00a7See A Briefe Memorial (recto A-A2) Mirror, for Magistrates 1559. \njaSee reproduction and notes in Trans. XIII (1932) 154-7+ \ntaOne is in the British Museum (Grenville), another is in the Morgan, a third is in the Folger Library, and \nwe have seen four others listed in catalogues. \nttaHaslewood estimated that if Wayland included all of the text which was later printed in Marshe\u2019s edition \nof the Mirror for Magistrates 1559 (q.v.l, in the format of these leaves his edition would have filled only \ntwenty-five or thirty leaves. \n\u00a7aThe reason for the suppression of this edition has been pointed out by W.C.Trent and elaborated by \nMiss Feasey (Trans. III (1923) 177)+ . \n}oThis would account for the fact that in no copy which we have traced, and this book is not uncommon, is \na genuine blank [Gg4] preserved. However, it should be noted that Baldwin in the dedication of the 1559 \nedition says that the Mirror for Magistrates \u2018was begun and parte of it printed\u2019 by Wayland which appar- \neasonable doubt as to whether Baldwin there refers to the \n\nently should settle the question were there not r f \n\u00a3 it which he later was able to see published. \n\nbook as originally conceived or merely to that portion o \n\nVOL.I [ 87]\n\nThe cause of the extraordinary signature marks used in this edition can only be con- \njectured. The most reasonable explanation, however, seems to be that Wayland divided \nthe work between two compositors, one of whom was to do the first seven books, and \nthe other, starting with the eighth book, was to complete the volume including the \nMirror for Magistrates. The second compositor began his portion with Sig Aa, Fol. 1, \nso that the compositor of the first portion as he approached the end of his task, finding \nthat he could not manage with a regular alphabet of twenty-three signatures and was \nprevented from doubling in the usual way, was compelled to employ symbols instead of \nletters. In corroboration of this explanation it may be observed that the leaf-numbers \nin the first portion are all prefixed \u2018Leaf.\u2019, while those in the later portion are \u2018Fol.\u2019. \nThere would appear to be large-paper copies of this book for, while the present copy \nhas ample margins, copies are known which are more than an inch taller, but in those \nwhich we have examined, though not among the largest known, the paper is the same \nas in the present. \nCopies of this book occasionally occur bound with Wayland\u2019s edition of Bieston\u2019s \nThe bayte & snare of fortune, e.g. one of the Folger copies, Sotheby 18 July 1933, et al. \nBoth issues of the Bieston are undated but it was presumably printed about the same \ntime as the present and perhaps was intended, the subject being somewhat similar, \nto be issued in /iew of the suppressed Memorial.",

There are in all some twenty-odd pieces addressed to English- \nmen} as well as one \u2018De urbe Londino & Thamesi fluvio\u2019. The interest of this work is \nnot so much in the merit of Bourbon\u2019s Latinity, he was not a great poet, but in the fact \nthat here English Renaissance scholars, patrons, and artists mingle on the same pages \nwith their contemporaries on the continent: Anne Boleyn and Marguerite d\u2019 Angouleme, \nThomas Cranmer and Jean Grolier, the Frellons and Thomas Berthelet, et al. Such \nlaudatory addresses as that which the author gives to Berthelet are uncommon in the \nearly history of English printing and as the poem does not appear to have been \non it has been thought worth quoting here in full (Zid. VI, Carmen LXII, \nP-354): \n\nAn alphabetical list of the persons addressed may be found in the Rothschild Cat. IV, 76-82. \ntE.G.Duff The Printers, Stationers of London 1476 to 1535, p-181, refers only to the Basle reprint of 1540+ \n\n[ 90 ]\n\nAD BEeRTELETUM REGIUM IN ANGLIA BIBLIOPOLAM \nHoc mane primum, Bertelete, te domi \nTue alloquutus & tuam \nVxorculam, o Dij boni quam feminam, \nTaliq; quam dignam uiro: \nDixi continuo mecum: funt Britannici \nCandoris hac preludia, \nIn Gallia adhuc agenti que predixerant \nComplufculi ex uestratibus. \nNangq; obtulifti libere, & gratis libros: \nEt, fi uelim, pecuniam. \nMox, ut meum uidi puerum uolumina \nTractare nefcio quot noua, \n(Quod munus illi dederas ad me clanculum) \nO quanta liberalitas \n(Clamaui) ut illum, quem prius non noueris, \nSic accipias humaniter. \nO Bertelete, fi tui fimillimos \nMultos habet Britannia, \nAutore CHRISTO, fomniare definam \nPatrem, meamq; Galliam: \nEt quos Lutetia reliqui amiculos: \nHic uiuere, hic mori uelim. \n\nThe portrait of the author which occurs on verso [M7] was previously used in the \n1536 edition of Bourbon\u2019s Hadeywyeou. It was designed by Holbein, the original draw- \ning being still preserved at Windsor. This is of particular interest because one of the \npoems in this book, \u2018De morte picta a Hanso pictore nobili\u2019, p.427, has been adduced \nas evidence for the attribution to Holbein of his Dance of Death series. The other \nportrait has also been assigned to Holbein by M.Picot but it is doubtful if other \nscholars will support that attribution. \n\nE.Ph.Goipscumipr Gothic and Renaissance Book-bindings 1,278.

Concerning a \npartial reissue in 1626, see below. \nIn all copies known except the present and one of the British Museum copies (239. \nd. 9) of the 1623 issue in the dedication to the first part Sir Thomas Huet\u2019s initials only \nare given. In all other copies, including those in the British Museum, the dedication to \nOmphale is to the \u2018Lady P.W., wife to... S.T.W. knight; and daughter to...

A close comparison shows that, except for the portions noted, the pages \ncontaining these alterations are from the same setting of type in both states. But which \nis the earlier and whether the full names were printed only in the dedication copies \ncannot now be ascertained. \nThe drop-heading to \u201cThe Shepheards Tales\u2019, p.175 (repeated) reads: \u2018HIS PAS- \nTORALLS | ARE HERE CONTINVED | WITH THREE OTHER TALES; hauing \nrelation to a former part, as yet ob-| fcured: . . . \u2019. Seven copiest of that \u2018former part\u2019 \n(S.T.C. 3584) are known. It consists of 24 leaves (A-C\u2019) with a drop-heading which \ndescribes the contents as \u2018The Shepheards Tales. The first part.\u2019 From the ornaments \nit was obviously printed by John Norton. The phrase \u2018as yet obscured\u2019 is so indefinite \nthat one cannot determine whether it refers to the manuscript which may have been \nlost or for some reason not available, or whether it means, simply, not yet printed. The \nfact that Norton instead of Field printed it may even indicate that the manuscript of \nthat part had fallen into the hands of another bookseller with whom Whitaker was \n\n{From the evidence of this device the cancel title was probably printed by John Haviland. \ntThree of them are found separately bound with titles prefixed from the same setting used for the separate- \ntitle on p.[175] of the present (reproduced Clawson Cat. p.25). These separate copies are the Hoe-Hunt- \nington, the Taylour-Park-Utterson-Mitford-Huth-White copy now at the Rosenbach Company, and the \n\nJones-Clawson. The Hoe-Huntington is said to have a blank conjugate with the title which indicates \nseparate imposition. \n\n[ 98 ]\n\nforced to treat. At any rate, one copyf{ of the 1621 issue of the present, and both the \nknown copies of the 1623 issue, have the \u2018former part\u2019 inserted after sheet M. \nApparently this book did not sell very well for in 1626 Whitaker disposed of some \nremainder copies to Robert Bostocke. He discarded the first part of the book (through \nsheet M) cancelled the original dedication of the \u2018former part\u2019 to Richard Hutton, Esq. \n(Sig A) and substituted a new half-sheet, signed A, containing a title: \u2018The Shepherds \nTales Reuised and Reuiued by R.B.Esquire. Two true poore Lovers . . . printed for \nRobert Bostocke, at the King\u2019s Head in Paul\u2019s Church yard, 1626\u2019, recto [A]; verso \nblank; dedication to Richard Louther, in verse, Sig A2; Prelude and Illustrations vpon \nthe Prelude, recto A3\u2014verso Aq. The reason for including Omphale in this issue, instead \nof the Shepheards Tales only, may be because it is mentioned on p.199 of the Tales. \nSince only the Huntington copy\u00a7 of this issue can be traced it is possible that it was not \na regular trade issue but instead merely a contrivance of Brathwait\u2019s for obtaining a \npresent from Louther. \nWhen Whitaker entered this book in the Stationers\u2019 Register 13th September 1619, \nonly \u2018eleauen Satires\u2019 were apparently written. His delay in printing enabled him to \nadd the miscellany which now forms the major part of this book. \n\nttViz. the Caldecott-Mitford-Prideaux-?

Sold Britwell sale, 1923, Lot 82. \n\nTuts rare poem is a handbook for the use of young men in all circumstances of life. It \nsets forth maxims and rules which, no doubt, are admirable but, except for the fact that \nthey are rhymed, have little right to the name of poetry. However, this volume, like \nnearly all works by this prolific and once popular author, is worth reading and like \nmost of them it is quite rare in the original edition. Only three other copies can be \ntraced}, viz. the British Museum (imperfect), Bodleian (Tanner), and the Huntington \n(Arbury). Of these, besides the present, the Huntington is the only perfect copy. \nIn the second edition, 1621, the dedication is omitted and the text begins on recto \n[Aq]. That text is not a paginary reprint of this which explains the incorrect catch- \nwords of Sig [Aq], which were carelessly copied from the present. \n\n{A fragment of the title is in the Bagford collection, Harleian 5919 : $93.

Apparently at one time bound up \nwith Lodge Scillaes Metamorphosis 1590 [q.v.], and probably with other works. From the library \nat Gaddesden Place, Hemel Hempstead, the property of Sir Walter Halsey, Bt., sold Sotheby\u2019s \n19 April 1932, Lot 331C. \n\nTuts collection was entered by Tappe, 16 January 1606 (Arber III.309), and it is \nbelieved to have been published about that time. At any rate, a copy of an edition \ndated 1607, is recorded in the Chatsworth Catalogue (1V,144) \u2018London, E.Allde \n(?for J.Tappe], 1607, 8vo.\u2019 but it is not unlikely that editions both earlier and later \nhave entirely disappeared. \nThese maxims and proverbs were evidently a very popular production for nine edi- \ntions (the latest, 1670) are extant although copies of all are very rare. \nUntil the appearance in 1932 of the present apparently unique copy in the auction \nrooms the earliest edition generally known was that of 1612 of which three copies are \nrecorded, the Bodleian (Chalmers), the Huntington (Heber-Britwell), and the Gaisford \ncopy which has not been located. \nIn the address Breton, speaking of these maxims, says rather obscurely that they are \n\u2018set downe with the dayes in the yeare\u2019, presumably in the manner of a modern cal- \nendar of quotations. A quick count gives only 357 maxims which perhaps is near \nenough. The title of this collection was probably chosen on account of the vogue of the \n\u201cWits Series\u2019 (see Politeuphuia Wits Common wealth 1598) with which it has a good deal \nin common although, of course, no direct connection. \n\nS.T.C.

Copies as clean and sound as the present are \nparticularly rare and have probably only been preserved in such fine condition because \nthey were for a long while mislaid or perhaps overlooked in some library.

However, Dr. Thomas and Mr. \nG.H.Hayes (Trans. VII (1926) 31-8) have proved that Piot was not Munday but \nanother, though somewhat obscure, individual. \nThe original of this book was published in Paris, 1581, under the title \u2018Epitome de \ncent histoires tragiques.\u2019 \nThe present is now chiefly remembered as a possible source for part of the plot of the \n\n[ 122 ]\n\nMerchant of Venice for here occurs the declamation headed \u2018Of a Jew who would for \nhis debt have a pound of the flesh of a Christian\u2019, p.400. However, it should be observed \nthat the story of this bond dates back to the Gesta Romanorum and the Cursor Mundi \nand that, as Shakespeare tells it, there are features which are not found in the present \nversion (which, in point of fact, may not have been published until after Shakespeare \nhad written his play) but occur in the source (J/ Pecorone IV, i, of Ser Giovanni \nFiorentino) from which van den Busche obtained it. In all likelihood, Shakespeare\u2019s \nplay was based on an earlier one, possibly the play of the \u2018Jew\u2019 mentioned by Gosson \n(Anders Shakespeare's Books p.144). \n\nS.T.C. 4182.

The first edition of this translation was published in 1624, the year \nfollowing Camden\u2019s death so that it is not now known whether it was made with his \nconsent or not. \nIn the first edition the dedication was signed \u2018W.Udall.\u2019, but most copies occur with \na cancel dedication signed \u2018Wil.

Neither Stranguage nor Udall can be identified but it is \nthought that the former is only a pseudonym for the latter. \nThe imprint given in S.T.C. 24511 is that found on the engraved title and does not \n\nconstitute another issue. \n\n}The original entry, 29 January 1624 (Arber IV.111), makes no secret of this source for it describes the \n\nwork as \u2018collected out of master Cambdens Annales.\u2019 \ntPreceding by a year Darcie\u2019s English translation of a French version of the Annales. \nS.T.C. 24510.

The rest of this title is from the same setting as in the other copies. A reason- \nable explanation of this variant imprint is that it represents an early state of this page; \nthat it was set-up from the title of the 1634 edition of the masque in which the imprint \nreads: \u2018London: | Printed for Thomas VValkley, and are to be fold | at his Shop neare \nWhite-Hall. | 1634. |\u2019; that in reading the proof Walkley discovered that his old address \n(he had apparently moved or adopted a new form of address about 1637, see Sayle II, \n968) was being preserved so he caused it to be altered before many sheets had been \nprinted. \nThis copy, as likewise the Chapin, has what is undoubtedly an earlier state of the \nerrata leaf. In it the list of errata is headed \u2018ERRATES.\u2019 and ends with the word \n\u2018fickle\u2019 in the sixth line. In the other two copies, the heading is corrected to \u2018ERRATA.\u2019 \nand another error is added to the list. \nIt is not unlikely that this copy is one of the \u2018extra\u2019 copies noted by Dr. Greg (Trans. \nXII (1931) 379) for besides the variants noted above the outer forme of sheet M has \nbeen strangely mutilated by the frisket. \n\n{The end words in the second and third lines, as well as the two final digits of the date, are drawn in with",

The engraved title to the first volume is inlaid, that to the second is inserted \nfrom a copy of the first volume with the part number in the fourth line altered in pen facsimile \nto \u2018second\u2019. Sig B4 in the second volume is inserted in type-facsimile. \n\nALTHOUGH it was not until 1892 that a copy of the 1612 edition of the first part was \nidentifiedtt, scholars had for some time recognized that the story of Don Quixote was \nfamiliarly known and apparently popular in England during the decade preceding \n1620. Allusions to it had been found, one of which occurs in a volume dated 1613, and \nseveral plays were known whose plots were derived from it. \nThough undated it is possible to deduce with some confidence the probable date of \nthe printing of the second edition of the first part. The second part is dated 1620 on \nthe letter-press title, and was from the evidence of the engraved title, see above, issued \nbefore the second edition of the first part\u00a7. But, as was pointed out by F.S.Ferguson \n(T.L.S. 15 May 1924, p.304), the state of the woodcut T on recto Sig B, indicates that \nthis reprint of the first part was made before Stansby printed, sometime in 1620, the \nsecond edition of Seneca\u2019s Moral Works so that while later than the second part, it \napparently succeeded it at a very brief interval. \nThe entry which Blount made for the second part, 15 December 1615, was for a \ntranslation of the spurious sequel published at Tarragona in 1614. Blount never pub- \nlished that translation and it is doubtful if it was ever made, although apparently he \nconsidered that entry sufficient for the present translation of the genuine second part. \nIt has been quite definitely shown by Fitzmaurice Kelly that Shelton translated the \nfirst volume from the Brussels Spanish edition of 1607, and the second volume from the \nBrussels edition of 1616, though the 1618 French translation certainly has some claims \nfor consideration.",

A small copy \nbut sound and clean. \n\nTuts second edition is the first illustrated and the first edition printed in England. \nThough for some time it was thought that this was the earliest book printed by Caxton \nin England, there is now no doubt that it was of a considerably later date. Blades has \nshown that the type, the justification of the lines and all the other bibliographical \nevidence point to circa 1481-3. \nThe first edition which Caxton printed at Bruges, 1475, contains a dedication to the \nDuke of Clarence. In this edition, as the Duke had died, Caxton substituted a prologue \nwhich, though in conception no more original than the dedication, does not occur in the \nmanuscripts from which he made this translation. He also corrected several misprints of \nthe first edition and inserted a new conclusion, see Axon\u2019s reprint, 1883. \nThough often noted as the earliest work on chess, Cessolis's book is only slightly \nconcerned with that game. In fact, chess is used merely as the framework upon which \nis based a moral tale concerning the transformation of Evilmerodach which was effected \nby a series of incidents which illustrate the relationships of various classes of society by \ntheir similarity to chessmen. Caxton translated from the French versions of Jean \n\n+Mr. Plomer has observed that one need look no further than the woodcuts in this volume to ascertain the \n\nreason why Caxton seldom sought assistance of engravers. \n\nVOL.I [ 141 ]\n\nFaron and Jean de Vignay but he sometimes introduced matter of his own regarding \n\nEnglish affairs. ; . \nFourteen copies of this edition can be traced of which only the Trinity College \n\nCambridge and the Maurice Johnson-Britwell (unlocated) copies are perfect.

According to Professor Parrott\u2019s edition copies exhibit \nmany other textual variations. \nThe Wrenn (Collier-Ouvry-Kerslake-Hadlow) copy has inserted a forged dedication \nto Sir Thomas Walsingham. This fabrication of Collier\u2019s muse was exposed by Mr. \nT.J. Wisett. \nIn 1652, the original sheets of six of Chapman\u2019s plays, viz. A/ fooles 1605; The blinde \nbeggar 1598; Bussy D\u2019 Ambois 1608; The gentleman usher 1606; An humerous dayes \nmyrth 1599; and Monsieur D\u2019Oliue 1606, were bound with a general-title reading: \n\u2018COMEDIES, | Tragi-Comedies; | & | TRAGEDIES: | WRITTEN | By GEORGE \nCHAPMAN | (device, McK.n.251\u00a2] | LONDON, | Printed Ann: Dom: 1652. |\u2019. This \ndevice in 1652 was presumably in the possession of William Hunt but whether he \nprinted the general-title for a private collector, for himself or for another bookseller, \nsuch as Moseley, cannot now be determined. The only copy known is the Wright \n(1787, Lot 1680)-Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington\u00a7 but a similar collection of the \nplays of John Marston (cf. Wonder of women 1606) with a general-title from the same \nsetting as the present, except for the sixth line, is also known by a single copy. It \nlikewise has been broken-up but the fact that both collections can be traced first in \nthe Wright 1787 sale inclines one to believe that they were perhaps prepared for a \nparticular collector and do not represent a normal reissue as do the collections of \nDryden, Lee, Nabbes [q.v.] and Shadwell. \n\nFor facsimile of the earlier state see H.F.House sale-catalogue, p.17. \nttSee letter of T.M.Parrott, Athenaeum I (1908) 788. \n\u00a7The volume has been broken-up and dispersed, mainly in the VIIIth duplicate sale 1918, only the Bussy \nD\u2019 Ambois and the general-title being retained. \n\nS.T.C. 4963.

Appar- \nently it was so understood, much to the discomfiture of the author who protested \nvigorously the innocence of his intention in a little tract, now very scarce, published \nby Lisle in the same year under the title: \u2018A free and offenceles iustification, of a lately \npublisht and most maliciously misinterpreted poeme: entituled Andromeda liberata\u2019. \nThe monster from whom Andromeda was rescued, he insisted, was no \u2018noble personage\u2019 \nbut the \u2018sauage multitude . . . from which in all right she was legally and formally \ndeliuered . . . And to this sense, I confinde the allegory throughout my Poeme; as \neuery word thereof, (concerning that point) doth cleerely and necessarilie demonstrate.\u201d \nSuch straining after hidden meanings gives some weight to the present fashion of \nallusion hunting.

Initials \n\u2018ICB\u2019 in circle written on title. \n\nTuere are three editions of this play dated 1605}. The first edition, which is the only \none to contain nine sheets, is known in two states. These states may be distinguished \nby the two leaves, Sig E3 and [E4] which in the earlier contain a passage (not, however, \nthe only one in the play) reflecting on the Scots. This passage, which is transcribed in \nfull in Trans. 1X (1928) 288, when brought to the attention of James caused the \nimprisonment of the authors} and very nearly according to report the loss of their ears. \nConsequently these leaves were suppressed and two new ones, with the offending \npassage omitted and with several other lines substituted, inserted in their placetf. \nThey may be distinguished by the catchword on verso E3 which in the cancellandum \nis \u2018Englifh\u2019, while in the cancellans it is \u2018roufly\u2019\u00a7. There are numerous other variations \nin the text, see Herford and Simpson IV, 490-5. In the present copy sheets A-B have \nthe uncorrected readings of the Wise; the inner forme of sheet D has the corrected \nreadings of the Dyce; Sig E has the uncorrected readings of the Wise; recto Sig E2 \nthe uncorrected readings of the British Museum; sheet F has the uncorrected readings \nof the British Museum; sheet G the corrected readings of the Wise except for the last; \nSig H the corrected readings of the Wise; and in sheet I the readings of Dyce except for \nthe last which is as the Wise. \nOf this state nine other copies can be located, viz. the British Museum (Ailesbury), \nBodleian (Malone), Dyce, Huntington, Yale, Boston Public (Devonshire-Huntington- \nClawson), W.A.Clark (Chew-Huntington), C.W.Clark (Britwell), and Worcester Col- \nlege Oxford. There is a copy in the Verulam collection, now on loan in the Bodleian, \nwhich may be of this issue. \n\n{The second and third editions both collate A-H\u2018, and may be easily distinguished by a reading in line 5 \nof the Prologus on verso title which in the second edition is \u2018oppofde\u2019 while in the third it is \u2018oppofd\u2019. \ntSee Chambers Eliz. Stage III, 254-6. \ntiThe Malone copy of this second issue is the only one traced which retains the stubs of the cancelled leaves. \nIt is therefore possible that in some copies, instead of a cancel half-sheet, the whole sheet was discarded \nand a new one which had the resetting of E3 and [4] substituted. \n\u00a7Of the first state no perfect copy is known: the Ashley copy lacks the title (one of the third edition is \nsubstituted); the Dyce, the only other copy known, merely has the two distinguishing leaves of the first \nstate inserted in acopy which until thenineteenth century possessed these leaves only in their second setting. \n\nS.T.C. 4971.

As these copies have all been rebound at one time or another it \nis impossible to state whether they were originally issued complete.

The \nRev. John Mitford (1860, II, Lot 2640)\u2014 Mark P. Robinson (II, 1918, Lot 164) copy with \nMitford\u2019s notes. \n\nTus, of course, is not a translation of Ovid but a poem in his manner. It has been \ncalled \u2018fat and foggy\u2019, but though dull in spots it nevertheless has many \u2018purple \npassages\u2019 and throughout is written in that rich Elizabethan tongue which from Chap- \nman\u2019s pen rings most clear in his continuation of Marlowe\u2019s Museaus. \nAs first issued in 1595 there was appended a translation of a poem (now attributed to \nWalter Mappes) entitled \u2018The amorous contention of Phillis and Flora\u2019, which, in 1598, \nwas separately reprinted under the initials \u2018R.S.\u2019. There is not much reason to insist \nthat Chapman was originally responsible for the translation of that poem\u2014 Richard \nSmith or more probably Richard Stapleton seem likelier candidates. \nThough no proof by entry can be adduced there seems no reason to doubt that Alsop \nand Fawcett came by their rights in this book legitimately through Alsop\u2019s early con- \nnections with William White. It would seem that this is an instance where a printer \nhaving bought out another assumes possession not only of his shop and furniture but \nalso of his copyrights. These last without the formality of entry he may either exercise \nhimself or pass on unimpaired when he in turn sells out. For example, in this case the \nfirst edition was published by Richard Smith, 1595, who does not appear to have \n\n[ 156 ]\n\nentered for it. Smith died or at least ceased all further publishing by the end of 1597}, \nand appears to have passed over to Abel Jeffes most of his copyrights, without making \na formal transfer. Jeffes had previously obtained from Smith the right to at least one \ntitle, namely Gascoigne\u2019s Workes (q.v.], and had had other dealings with him. However in \n1598, Jeffes transferred eight titles, four including the present certainly derived from \nSmith, to a William Wood (Arber III.131). There is something unexplained about \nthis transfer for of the eight titles Wood printed only two (S.T.C. 17349 and 16910, \nthese being the sum of his known activity) but those two were later, 2 August 1602, \nclaimed by Edward White. Evidently after this \u2018flyer\u2019 Wood dropped out of the pub- \nlishing business and the copyrights reverted to Jeffes. In 1598, however, the poem of \n\u2018Phillis and Flora\u2019 which, as noted above, had been appended to the first edition of the \npresent, was separately printed by William White for Richard Jones. Jones, like Jeffes, \nhad been associated with Smith and so possibly came into possession of rights in the poem \nlegitimately. Or, since in the separate edition the implied attribution to Chapman is \ndropped and the initials \u2018R.S.\u2019 substituted, it may be that the translator, possibly \nStapleton, desired that his work should not be connected with Chapman\u2019s and when \nJeffes transferred to Wood Ovids Banquet of Sense it was arranged that the \u2018Phillis and \nFlora\u2019 should go to Jones. In any case, it is not of great importance for White bought \nout both Jones and Jeffes and it must have been from White that Alsop acquired his \nrights\u2014that is if they really were legitimately secured by him. \nThis anonymous edition was probably issued as the result of public interest in \nOvid in 1639. In that year at least three translations were issued, viz. Saltonstall\u2019s \nHeroicall Epistles, and De Ponto (q.v.], and Catlin\u2019s De Tristibust. \n\n{Smith\u2019s name is found in the imprints of editions of Markham Discourse of Horsemanship printed in 1596 \n(copy at Huntington Library) and 1597 (copy also Huntington). See, however, an entry concerning \nMarkham\u2019s book in Greg Court Records, p.68. \n{Michael Sparke was the publisher of the first two, and it may be noted that, though the De Tristidus was \nissued by J.Bellamie it was printed by the same printer and uniform in typography and format with the \nDe Ponto. Furthermore, Gower\u2019s Ovia\u2019s Festivalls {q.v.], though dated 1640, and printed at Cambridge, \nmay have been issued in the same year and was certainly sold by Sparke. All of these editions are uniform \nin size and occur bound together in a volume, now in the British Museum (1068.g.20), which also contains \none of the undated editions of Marlowe\u2019s A// Ovid\u2019s Elegies (S.T.C. 18933) and of Heywood\u2019s De Arte \nAmandi (18935%). These last two contain identical ornaments and types and were probably issued about \n1639, possibly by Sparke. \n\nS.T.C. 4986. Hunrincton C.L., 76. Corser Collectanea Il, 289. Hutu Car. I, 297.

Bookplate of Charles Lord Maynard. \n\nHazuirr conjectured that this volume must have been printed before 1614, because a \ncopy formerly in Heber\u2019s library, but now not traceable, had a presentation inscription \nto Lord Russell who died in that year. However, the fact that Willem van der Passe \ndid not begin work in England until 1621, and John Bill did not become King\u2019s Printer \nuntil July 1617, precludes as early a date as that, for publication at any rate. Since the \nHeber copy lacked the engraved title, it is possible that the book was printed a decade \nbefore it was published, but if so the valediction needs to be explained. \nMany copies, including the present, were apparently corrected by Chapman himself \nor by someone who wrote a hand remarkably like his, for several which we have seen \nhave manuscript corrections in the same places made by the same hand and that one \nwhich appears to be Chapman\u2019s. \nSeveral large-paper copies are known. One which has the arms of Archbishop Williams \nmeasures 1234 x 814 inches; it was formerly in the Britwell Library and is now owned \nby Dr.W.S.Stone. Another is in the Chatsworth Library. This last was a presentation \ncopy as are also those in the Inner Temple Library and the Widener copy at Harvard. \nCopies sometimes occur bound with the J/iads and Odyssey with a general-title The \nWhole Works. Such copies apparently always have the later (c.1640) printing of the \nIiads but not all copies in which the latter occurs also contain the present. \n\n{Three blocks from Denham\u2019s Monument series, McK. and F.n.174 (headpiece), 179 (tailpiece), and 181 \n(tailpiece), which were at this time in the possession of Humphrey Lownes were apparently borrowed \nfor use in this book. Most of the initials here used appear in books printed by John Haviland in 1624-5. \nfIn the later state the open book has a Greek inscription, the spelling of the last word of the second line has \nbeen altered to \u2018WORKES\u2019, and several more frogs and mice are introduced on the left. Both states are \n\nin the Huntington Library. \n\nVOL.I [ 163 ]\n\nThis was the last of Chapman\u2019s Homeric labours and completes the series.

On blank \npage at end are early signatures of Henry Palmer, John Norton, Robert Eyre, Richard Blunt, \nand Edw. Eyre. \n\nIn 1526, Pynson printed three Chaucer volumes which are bibliographically distinct \nand are not connected by a general-title nor any other link except similarity of form \nand identity of date, although several of the rare examples known are now bound \ntogether. That first collected edition contains the Canterbury Tales, Troilus and Cres- \nsida, The House of Fame, and several non-Chaucerian pieces. The present is, however, \nthe earliest \u2018critical\u2019 attempt at an edition of Chaucer\u2019s Works. The fact that only \neighteen and a half poems here printed are genuine while twenty-two and a half are \nspurious indicates that the editor\u2019s enthusiasm was considerably greater than his criti- \ncal capacityt. Nevertheless, for several pieces this edition contains the best or the \nearliest text and has been thought of sufficient importance to be reproduced in facsimile \nby the Oxford Pressf. It was for two centuries and a half the standard text of the \nCanterbury Tales. \nThe insertion of Henryson\u2019s The Testament of Creseyde was apparently a last minute \nalteration. Originally Sig Qq3 had on the recto the end of the fifth Boke of Troy/us and \nthe title, in compartment, of The Legende of Good Women; the verso was blankt}. The \nquire then contained only six leaves, Sig Qq4-[6] were occupied by the text of The \nlegende. When it was decided to insert The testament, Sig Qq3 was cancelled and inserted \nin its place were two sheets (the first two leaves of which were signed \u2018Qq3-4\u2019 \u2014the first \nleaf numbered with the folio of the cancellandum). These inserted sheets contain a \nreprinting of the end of Troylus, the text of The testament, and the title (without a \ncompartment) of The legende. \nOnly one other dated book was issued by Godfray\u00a7. Despite its size, this is a rare \nbook in fine condition. Copies are known which are more than an inch taller than the \npresent. \n\nHowever, this disability has been counterbalanced by modern enthusiasm for prototypes which has \ndubbed this book \u2018the first English poetical miscellany\u2019. \n}See W.W.Skeat\u2019s introduction to this edition and W.W.Greg Early editions of \u2018Canterbury Tales\u2019 (P.M. \n\nL.A.

In that issue the title is not in \na compartment but has a large woodcut of a Chaucer\u2019s arms dated 1560, reproduced \nGrolier Club L-W, p.33. The title (verso blank), dedication, table, and verses occupy \nSig 2\u00ae -[2\u00ae 4] as in the present; but the division-title to \u2018The Caunterburie Tales\u2019, in \ncompartment, McK. and F.n.75, occupies recto [A]; verso blank; the prologues, recto \nA2-recto [A6]; blank, verso [A6]. Thus in the second issue there are ten leaves, instead \nof fourteen, before Sig B; the quire signed \u201cK\u2019 is omitted. There are copies of that \nissue with the first title retained. Whether they are made-up copies or not cannot be \ndetermined. \nThe majority of the pieces added by Stowe to this, his first edition, are spurious. \nMany occur in the Trinity College Cambridge Codex R3, 19, which may have been \nStowe\u2019s source. This was his first published work and is hardly a creditable performance. \n\nS.T.C. 5075. Huntincow C.L., 78. Grower Cius L-W, 32 (tp. facs.). Hor Car. I (1903) \n260.",

Chaucers woorkes to \nPrint for the companye\u2019 and Adam Islip in the entry quoted above obtained the con- \nsent (\u2018appointment\u2019) of Jeffes, paying sixpence in the pound to the Company. Never- \ntheless, Bishop\u2019s widow was permitted in 1611 to transfer to Thomas Adams her \nhusband\u2019s \u2018parte of Chawcers workes\u2019 (Arber III.454). \nThis is the first edition edited by Speght who had the assistance of John Stowe, \nFrancis Thynne, Francis Beaumont, the elder, and Robert Glover. The most remark- \nable feature of this edition is the glossary which was largely the editor\u2019s production and \nwas the main object of Francis Thynne\u2019s Animadversions. \n\nS.T.C. 5077.

It is dated 1603, and brazenly asserts on \nthe title that it is \u2018imprinted for Thomas Millington and to be sold by Walter Burre.\u2019 \nThe only copies of the Burre edition which can be traced are the Bridgewater-Hunt- \nington, and the Folger. According to Collier the principal difference between the two \neditions is that the note regarding the errata (which in the first edition affords evidence \nas to the authorship) is omitted in the pirated second, the errata being corrected. He \nalso states that a list of the twelve barons who carried \u2018bannerols\u2019 at the funeral was \ninserted in \u2018The order and proceeding\u2019 in that edition. \n{This ornament which closely resembles McK.n.369, is of common occurrence in English printing although \n\nprobably of continental origin. The numerous castings or copies differ only slightly. The earliest use in \nthis collection is in 1585, in Tottel Songes and Sonnets, printed by Windet; the latest is in 1671, in Caryll \n\nSir Saloman, printed by Newcombe. \n\nVOL.I [ 181 ]\n\nThe present pamphlet is written partly in prose and partly in verse, and on the whole \nis an interesting and well written tribute to \u2018the right gratious Queene Elizabeth.\u2019 One \nportion which is particularly attractive describes at some length the character and \nvirtuous qualities of the Queen illustrating the discourse with anecdotes. The whole is \nwritten in the form of a dialogue, partly in verse, between Thenot and Collin, and in \nthe usual \u2018The king is dead! Long live the king!\u2019 fashion ends with the Spring Song \n\u2018in gratulation. . . to. . . James.\u2019 \nThe present value of this book, however, lies not so much apparently in its intrinsic \nmerit, as in the fact that in one place Chettle complains that the poets \u2018that are best \nable, scarce remember her Maiestie . . . . Nor doth one Poet seeke her name to raise, \nThat liuing hourely striu\u2019d to sing her praise\u2019 being too intent upon welcoming the \nStuartt. He goes on and reproaches several, Daniel, Warner, Chapman, Jonson, Shake- \nspeare, Drayton and others not by name, but by allusions to their works. For example, \nhe calls upon Shakespeare under the name of Melicert to \n\u2018remember our Elizabeth, \nAnd sing her Rape, done by that Tarquin, Death.\u2019 \nTen other copies have been traced, of which several are imperfect for since the Shep- \nheards Spring Song is mentioned on the title its omission in the text cannot be explained \nby calling a copy lacking it an early issue. The present location of the Britwell copy \nis not known; nor, unless it is the Harvard copy, that of the W. Wiper (Sotheby\u2019s 16 \nJanuary 1891)-T.J.McKee (Dec. 1901, Lot 2810) copy. The Grenville (imperfect) and \nFillingham-Heber copies are in the British Museum, the Malone in the Bodleian, the \nHuth in the Huntington, the Walpole-Britwell-Halliwell (Calendar No.s, imperfect) \nand the Halliwell-Locker in the Folger, the Halliwell-White at Harvard, and a copy \n(sold at Hodgson\u2019s in 1933) in the possession of Bernard Quaritch Ltd. \n\nfit is an interesting fact that though some sixteen broadsides and pamphlets were issued in 1603 to com- \n\nmemorate the death of the Queen, two at least being collections, they do not include anything from the \nfirst rank of the so-called Elizabethan poets. \n\nS.T.C. 5121.

From such evidence as we have it appears to have been pro- \nduced shortly thereafter\u2014probably February or March 1600. By some chance a copy \nfell into the hands of (or perhaps was more actively acquired by) a printer. Henslowe \nwas informed of this and in order to protect his property \u2018Lent vnto Robarte shawe \nthe 18 of march 1599 to geue vnto the printer to staye the printing of patient gresell \nthe some of . . . xxxxs, [signed] by me Robt Shaa\u2019 (Greg Henslowe\u2019s Diary 1, 119). \nEvidently his bribe was effective for ten days later Cuthbert Burby, who very likely \nwas \u2018the printer\u2019 referred to in Henslowe\u2019s note, entered for his copy in the Stationers\u2019 \nRegister, not for the purpose of publishing it but in order to prevent others from so \ndoing. \nBy 1603, however, either the play was no longer a drawing card at the Fortune \nTheatre or Burby thought he had fulfilled his contract, for he turned over his copy to \nRocket who had been apprenticed to him and whom he had presented to his freedom \nthe preceding year. So it came about that Rocket published the first, and only, early \nedition. \nCopies are exceedingly scarce. The only other ones of which there appear to be \nrecord are the Heber-Devonshire-Huntington, the Ireland-Roxburghe-George III- \nBritish Museum, and the Kalbfleisch-White-Folger copies}. The copy here described \nwas presented to Collier by the Duke of Devonshire when he acquired the Heber copy. \n\n{Collier in his reprint, 1841, states that there is a copy in the Bodleian; but the only mention of it is a cross- \nreference in the 1847 appendix to the Bodleian printed catalogue, the main entry for which does not \nappear. That copy, if it ever existed, cannot now be found. \nS.T.C. 6518. ARBER III. 158. HuntincTon C.L., 110. Locker Car. (1886) 34.

Thus the present edition bearing Perry\u2019s name was probably issued as the \nresult of some private arrangement with Grove. The address, the sign of the Harrow, \nis not recorded. \nThis play unfortunately was very corruptly printed. It was written according to \nHenslowe\u2019s records late in 1602, and was probably only the second part of The Danish \nTragedy which Henslowe mentions earlier in the same year. Though corrupt it affords \nsome measure of Chettle\u2019s power as a dramatist. \n\nS.T.C. 5125. ARBER IV. 229. Huntincton C.L.,79. Hor Cat. I (1903) 274. W.A.WHITE \nCar., 24,",

The first edition was sep- \narately printed but is usually found bound with either the first or second edition of \nCaxton\u2019s Chronicle. It was compiled by Caxton from the Liber Primus of Trevisa\u2019s \ntranslation of Higden\u2019s Polycronicon. \nPerfect copies are rare and it is doubtful if another copy as fine as the present could \nbe found. We can trace only nine other copies, viz. the Grenville and the imperfect \n(lacking 8 leaves of text) King\u2019s Library copies in the British Museum; the imperfect \n(lacking 11 leaves) copy in the Bodleian, the imperfect Stillingfleet-Marsh copy which \nlacks the tabula, the Lord Foley-W.D.Breaker-Sinclair Hamilton (imperfect) copy, \nthe copy at Exeter College Oxford (condition not known), the imperfect copy in the \nSociety of Antiquaries (London), and the copy now at Bernard Quaritch Ltd. which is \npresumably made-up from the two imperfect copies purchased at auction in 1913 \nand 1922. \n\nApparently some of these additions are derived from Rolewinck\u2019s Fasciculus Temporum though not a close \ntranslation of the text of any one of four editions of that work which we have examined. \n\nS.T.C. 9997.

According to the Corser \nsale catalogue this copy was in the Bibliotheca Anglo-Poetica (1815, No.10s, later James Perry I, \n1822, Lot 1289), but if so a genuine title has since been substituted for the manuscript one there \ndescribed. This is possibly the second J.D.Gardner copy. \n\nTHE gap at p.170 (verso Aa2) was apparently due to a miscalculation when the copy \nwas divided between two compositors. The piece which ends at that point, \u2018A Tragical \nDiscourse of the Haplesse mans life\u2019, is reprinted from the Chippes where in both the \n1575 and 1578 editions it contains 103 stanzas and occupies thirteen leaves. Five \nstanzas were added and one omitted in this reprint and, when the division was made, \nit was supposed that it would then fill approximately fourteen leaves but by using \nsmaller type and crowding the stanzas closer together the compositor managed to get \nthe whole on less than twelve leaves and so was able to dispense with the half-sheet \nAa3-4 (pp-171-4). \nThe gap at p.198 (verso [Dd4]), however, is only to be explained by conjecture. This \ntime the signatures are consecutive, as is also the text, though the poem, \u2018Truth \nagainst the flattrie of time\u2019, up to that point is printed in alternately rhymed couplets \nwhile on the next page (p.209, recto Ee1) it is compressed into long rhymed couplets. \nIf the copy was divided between two compositors at this point it would explain the \ngap in pagination but not the continuous signatures, even if one postulates an omission \nof four or five leaves of text. \nThis miscellany collection both in verse and prose is one of the most interesting and \nimportant of Churchyard\u2019s numerous productions. It was gathered together by the \nauthor in order to preserve many of his works and to prevent their appropriation by \nothers. Perhaps the worthy man believed that his end was not far off though he lingered \non for a decade longer. \nAs printed in this volume a number of the pieces are considerably altered and \naugmented; for that reason it is of some importance textually but possibly derives a \nlarge measure of interest from the fact that it includes a list of such of the author's \nworks as he was able to call to mindf. \nOnly nine other copies are recorded, viz. the British Museum (Grenville), Bodleian, \nPeterborough Cathedral, Huntington (Hoe), Harvard (Crawford-White), Bemis \n(Utterson-Gardner-Locker-Chew-Huntington-Jones-Chew), two copies now owned by \n\n$See Corser Collectanea and Huth Prefaces Dedications and Epistles.

The second issue has another cancel \ntitle which describes itself as \u2018The 24 EDITION\u2019, notes that Birch\u2019s Sermon is \u2018added\u2019, \nand has the imprint: \u2018Printed by D.Edwards in Fetter-Lane. 1700.\u201d Copies of all three \nissues are in the British Museum. \n\nThough now chiefly remarkable as containing the first printing of two of Congreve\u2019s \n\n{The Grenville copy, which lacks the folding plate, has instead a line engraving of the death of Lady Gethin, \nwhich is little better than chapbook engraving. It is, apparently, exceedingly rare. \n\n[ 202 ]\n\npoems, this volume is also interesting as an early example of an unconscious literary \nfraud for the Religuiae instead of being the original composition of the Lady Gethin, \nas her family supposed when found among her papers, are simply extracts (chiefly \nfrom Bacon) which she had copied into her commonplace-bookt. \nAccording to the Premonition (verso a), \u2018A few Copies being only intended to be \nPrinted, enough to preserve her Memory, and for the private use of some persons who \nwere. . . personally acquainted with her. . . \u2019, but the book is not as rare as that \nwould seem to indicate and the imprint of the present issue is not in the form usually \nassociated with privately printed books. \nThe Inscription printed on p.[24] of the Sermon, which is repeated on recto [Aq] of \nthe same, appears to be from the same setting in both except that on recto [Aq] there \nis added a paragraph beginning \u2018Her Disconsolate and Afflicted Parents. ...\u2019 A paper \nis pasted over the Inscription on p.[24] in this copy and probably once was in all. \nPerhaps it is no reflection on the relations of the Nortons to their son-in-law, but \nrather on the unsettled state of Ireland at that time that in the Premonition (recto \na) is a reference to \u2018. . .

However, there is somewhat contradictory evidence in that \nthe dedication to the first part which is signed by Henry Olney (presumably the book- \nseller of that name though this cannot be established) is obviously merely a trial balloon \narranged in accordance with the convention that the printing of his work is contrary \nto the author\u2019s desire.

It is not known what arrangement Hill made with Park at that time. \nGilchrist later sold Park\u2019s library to Longmans who catalogued most of the collection, anonymously, in \nthe Bibliotheca Anglo-Poetica which Griffiths compiled for them in 1815.

The folding plates in remarkably fine state. \n\nA.tHoucn this book was entered by Edmund Blount and William Barrett\u00a7, 26 Novem- \nber 1610, there is reason to believe that they did not publish it for Ben Jonson states \nin his acrostic, recto [a2], that Coryate \u00ab|... sets it out at his owne charge; And \ntherein . . . Shewes he dares more than Paul\u2019s Churchyard durst do.\u2019, and Henry \nParrot (Lacquei ridiculosi Epigram 144, line 6) sneered that \u2018Tom Coriat solde the \nBooks he made himselfe.\u2019 which would seem to indicate that Coryate was forced to \nbring the book out at his own expense, and also would account for the absence from the \ntitle of any publisher\u2019s namefa. \nThere probably has never been another such combination of learning and uncon- \nscious buffoonery as is here set forth. Coryate was a serious and pedantic traveller who \n(as he states in his title) in five months toilsome travel wandered, mostly on foot, over \na large part (by his own reckoning 1,975 miles) of western Europe. His adventures \nprobably appeared to his contemporaries as more ridiculous than exciting, but at this \nremove his chronicle by its very earnestness provides an account of the chief cities of \nearly seventeenth century Europe which is at least as valuable as it is amusing. \nIt was probably his difficulties with the booksellers which induced Coryate to solicit \nthe extraordinary sheaf of testimonials prefixed to the volume. Possibly he acted upon \nthe notion apparently now current among publishers of social directories that every \nperson listed is a prospective purchaser of the work. At any rate he secured contribu- \ntions from more than sixty writers of the time. Among his panegyrists appear the names \nof Jonsonta, Chapman, Donne, Campion, Harington, Drayton, Davies of Hereford, \nand others, each contributor vying to mock poor Coryate with solemn ridicule. The \namazing part of the whole affair now is, not that they were able to produce so much, \nbut that, as Parrot expressed it (Lacguei ridiculosi, Epigram 130), apparently Coryate \nhoped \u2018 . . . the more a man rayles on him, The more he will in time bestow vpon \nhim.\u2019 \nDuring the winter of 1610-1611, this baiting of Coryate was apparently the talk of \nall literary London. Coryate even applied (see his petition printed in his Cram\u00e9e) to \nPrince Henry for permission to dedicate the book to himt{a. The result was that, as \nsuch things often do, it went too far, and following its course (see Odcombian Banquet) \n\nthrough the next year one cannot but feel that Tom Coryate was treated far worse \nthan he deserved. \n\n\u00a7Barrett\u2019s share passed to Parker 3 April 1626 (Arber IV.158) who, 4 September 1638 (Arber IV.433)s \ntransferred his rights in the title to Haviland and Wright. \ntaSixty-five years later Cotton states in his Compleat Angler p.20,\u2018. . . I will sit down and write my \nTravels, and like Tom Coriate print them at my own charge.\u2019 \ntalt has been stated, but without citation of authority, that Jonson undertook to edit these encomiums. \nPerhaps this notion may have arisen from the fact that nearly all those known to have belonged to what \nwould now be called the \u2018Mermaid Tavern group\u2019 or the \u2018Jonson school\u2019 are here represented. \nHaThe dedication copy is now in the British Museum. It is in a plush binding. \n\n[ 216 ]\n\nThere seems to have been some difficulty in procuring a license for printing; Arch- \nbishop Bancroft having died suddenly and Abbott, Bishop of London, though earnestly \naddressed by Mr. Lawrence Whitaker through his Chaplain, Dr. Mocket, declining to \ngrant one on the plea of not being able to \u2018allowe any books to be printed but theolog- \nical\u2019. Apparently, the good offices of Prince Henry had finally to be obtained. \nWe have examined four copies in original binding, either calf or vellum, and have \nheard of several others. These copies are all immaculate with the original deckle on the \nplates and though some have the appearance, and indeed have been so described, of \nlarge-paper, they are none of them more than an eighth of an inch taller than the \npresent or on a different paper. Perfect copies with the plates intact are not common{a. \n\n\u00a7aThe D.N.B. has repeated the statement that the Chetham copy is the only perfect one known. \n\nS.T.C. 5808. ARBERIII. 449.

If further \nevidence is necessary it may be found in Thorpe\u2019s reputation as a purveyor of \u2018strayed\u2019 \nliterature (see Sir Sidney Lee\u2019s introduction to the Clarendon facsimile of Shakespeare\u2019s \nSonnets 1609). Presumably, as explained in the note regarding the Crudities, though \nBarrett and Blount had entered that work in the Stationers\u2019 Register they were not \nthe publishers and so Coryate was helpless to prevent Thorpe from pirating that por- \ntion of his book which had served to make it the subject of the tavern-talk of literary \nLondon and perhaps, also, a fair publishing speculation. \nUndoubtedly Coryate brought it all on his own thick-skulled and prodigiously vain \nhead but what began as a rather amusing joke was finally carried to such lengths that \none can only pity poor \u2018witlesse wise\u2019 Coryate and sympathize with him in his pro- \ntestations. To be the butt of \u2018tavern witts\u2019 may have its compensations if among them \nare included such poets as Jonson, Drayton and Donne, but to become the scape-goat \nfor such a professional mountebank as John Taylor\u00a7 would be insufferable. \n\nFrom the fact that the Cram\u00e9e is mentioned on the title of the present, though nowhere else, it is necessary \nto assume that that book was at least advertised for publication\u2014it was entered in the Stationers\u2019 Reg- \nister 7th June 1611\u2014and Sig [Ga] of the Cram\u00e9e being a blank, that it was probably already in circulation \nbefore Coryate appended that protest to the unsold copies. However, no copy of the Cram\u00e9e lacking sheet \nH can be located although one, at least, viz. that in the Capell collection, has had sheets a-b*; c-g8; h-l* \ninserted from the Crudities. \n\u00a7See Taylor\u2019s The Sculler and Laugh, and be fat: or, A commentary vpon the Odcombyan Banket, etc. \n\nS.T.C. 5810.

From the library of Lord Middleton \n\nat Wollaton Hall (1925, Lot 77), see below. \n\nNeETHERCOT, despite the imprint, conjectured that copies with the present title were \nissued privately for circulation among the members of the then recently founded Royal \nSociety; and that copies which have another title were for public sale. The other title \nreads: \u2018A | PROPOSITION | For the | ADVANCEMENT | Of | LEARNING. | \n[rule] | By A-COWLEY. | [rule] | VIRG. | 0 Fortunati quorum jam Meenia | furgunt! | \n[rule] | LONDON, | Printed by 7.M. for Henry Herringman, | and are to be fold at his \nShop at the | Blew Anchor in the Lower-Walk of | the New-Exchange, 1661. |\u2019. \nIt is not unlikely that that was actually the case. For the \u2018Proposition for the advance- \nment of learning\u2019 is the title under which this tract was entered in the Stationers\u2019 Reg- \nister. That title was printed on the recto of Sig [A] which in the present issue is can- \ncelled and the quarter-sheet \u2018a\u2019 substituted. The fact that the quarter-sheet contains, \nbesides the altered title, the dedicatory epistle to the Royal Society{ makes it seem more \nprobable that these later issue copies were intended for presentation. However, against \nthis view may be placed the imprint and the fact that this issue is more frequently \nfound than the other, though neither is very common. \nThe present copy may well have originally belonged to Francis Willughby, the natu- \nralist, a charter fellow of the Royal Society, and father of the Thomas Willughby, Baron \nMiddleton whose signature it bears and in whose family it descended until sold at \nSotheby\u2019s in 1925. \nThis scarce little tract was one of several schemes drawn up by the founders of the \nRoyal Society and is of considerable interest to the historians of education. It sets forth \nthe plan of a college of experimental philosophy which would perform the useful func- \ntions of testing the natural history which had been handed down, recover the lost \nlearning of the ancients, improve the arts then known and discover that which was not \nknown. In many ways its conception seems much in advance of the time, and, while \nBaconian, much more practical in design. It is possibly the paper which was read before \nthe Society the 28th November 1660. \n\n{These initials have been ascribed to Philip Papillon, but that attribution is impossible as he died in 1641. \ni This reads: \u201cThe Author of the following discourse, having since his going into France allowed me to make \nit publick, I thought I should do it most right by presenting it to Your Considerations; to the end that \nwhen it hath been fully examined by You, and receiv\u2019d such Additions or Alterations as You shall think \nfit, the Design thereof may be promoted by Your recommending the Practice of it to the Nation.\u201d \n\nEyre II, 288.

The J.C. Williams (1929, Lot 1112) copy with bookplate. \nEighteenth century signature which appears to read: \u2018Christiani Laury Berlirans\u2019. \n\nTHERE is some reason for believing that the statement of the colophon that this book \nwas printed in London is true for the translator published there the following year, dedi- \ncated to the same patron, his translation into French of the Book of Common Prayer \nand consequently was probably already in England in 1552. Moreover, Pierre Angelin \nis probably the Huguenot of that name recorded in the Lists of Aliens, 1562, and prob- \nably also the man for whomt John Kingston printed Agnello\u2019s Italian alchemical tract \nEspositione sopra Apocalypsis spiritus secreti, 1566. In both cases Angelin probably was \nneither the bookseller nor publisher but merely the financial supporter of the enter- \nprise. The compartment which appears on the title was certainly, later, in England \nwhen it was used by Jugge and Cawood. \nThe Latin translation of this book by John Cheke, which was published on the con- \ntinent after Mary\u2019s accession, was apparently intended for a more international audi- \nence and was reprinted again on the continent as a means of defending the views on the \nsacrament of the Marian exiles. Michelangelo Florio\u2019s Italian translation of Cranmer\u2019s \nCatechismus has been demonstrated by H.Sellerst to have been printed at London by \nStephen Mierdman before his exile in 1553, and since the present was printed before the \ndeath of Edward VI, there is good analogous support for the belief that it was actually \nprinted in London as it purports to be. \n\n{The imprint reads: \u2018 . . . a instantia di Pietro Angelino...\u2019. \nTransactions V (1924-5) 105. \n\nVOL.I [ 233 ]\n\nHowever, though one may be fairly confident regarding the English printing of this \nbook there is little evidence with which the printer may be identified. Thomas Gaultier, \nwho printed the Book of Common Prayer translated by Philippe, 1553, was King\u2019s \nPrinter for French service books and the printer one would naturally expect to have \nbeen responsible for this book. But the types cannot be identified as his. The compart- \nment cannot be traced before 1570, but it is possible that it was part of the loot which \nJugge obtained from Whitchurch\u2019s shop on Mary\u2019s accession. Next to Gaultier, \nWhitchurch would seem to be the most likely candidate, but in his case also the types \ncannot be recognized in his signed work. \nNo other copy of this translation can be located, but though like all books of its kind \nprobably very scarce other copies are perhaps preserved unrecognized in the college or \ncathedral libraries of England. \n\nS.T.C. 6002 [a]. \n\nCREECH, Tuomas (1659-1700) Translator \nsee THEOCRITUS The idylliums 1684.",

The Britwell (1923, Lot 187) \u2014 \nClawson (I, 1926, Lot 172) copy with bookplate. \n\nTHERE are two editions dated 1592; the Rosamond is mentioned on their titles and is \nan integral part of each. In the first, the Delia consists of fifty sonnets; it collates: A, \nB-G#, H2, while the Rosamond collates: H3-M*. In the second, four sonnets are added \nto the Delia which then collates: A?, B-H*; while the Rosamond collates: LM, N?. The \nfact that a copy of the second edition of the Delia has been found bound with a copy of \nthe first edition of the Rosamond and that copies of both the first and second editions \nof the Delia are known which are bound with copies of still another setting of the Rosa- \nmond has apparently obscured the fact that in the 1592 editions the two parts were not \nbibliographically disjunct, so far as the evidence of form and paper is concerned, and \nthat there is no evidence that these parts were separately issued. Such combinations of \ndifferent editions of these parts as have been found are, presumably, ihe result a \n\u2018making-up\u2019 on the part of nineteenth century owners. For example, the \u2018third\u2019, really \n\nVOL.I [ 237 ]\n\nthe sixth, setting of the Rosamond}, of which the present is an instance, is none other \nthan the one regularly included in the Poeticall Essayes 1599 [q.v.]. It has the same \nwatermarks as are found in the portions of that volume dated 1599, and there can be \nno doubt that it also was printed at that time. \nIt is not clear why so many copies (six of the first edition and two of the second) \nlacked the Rosamond, so that they had to be completed with a part from another \neditiont. Only two complete copies of the first edition and two (one being imperfect) \nof the second are known, while of the eight \u2018made-up\u2019 copies, noted above, at least two \nlack the final leaf or leaves of the Delia. There can be little doubt but that their present \n\u2018completeness\u2019 is due to the misplaced industry of comparatively recent owners. \nThere is no need of insisting upon the importance of this work in the history of Eng- \nlish verse. Suffice it to say that the Ode at the end of the Delia is set to music in John \nFarmer\u2019s The first set of English madrigals 1599. \nFive other copies having, as the present, the Delia of the first edition and the Rosa- \nmond of the sixth (1599) setting, are recorded. Of these, one is at the Huntington \n(Collier-Ouvry-Locker-Halsey), others are the Chatsworth, A.S.W.Rosenbach (Lef- \nferts-White), Folger (Prideaux), and the Gosse (lacking several leaves) is in the pos- \nsession of a London bookseller. \nThere are copies of 1592 editions in the Hunterian Library at Glasgow and at Wad- \nham College Oxford which have not been distinguished. \n\n{There were editions dated 1594, 1595, and 1598. This last has only recently come to light, an imperfect \ncopy being in the British Museum. \ntJ.P.Collier suggested that the first edition of the De/ia was originally issued without the Rosamond which \nwas not printed until later, but such an explanation does not account for the fact that the Rosamond is \nmentioned on the title of the De/ia and was entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register at the same time. \n\nS.T.C. 6253.

Apparently, having completed \nthree books, he had them privately printedt by Nicholas Okes in 1612, in order that \nhe might distribute copies among his friends for criticism before continuing his labours. \nOkes entered this title 20 April 1612, but Simon Waterson, Daniel\u2019s usual publisher \nand the executor of his will, obtained an order from the court of wardens, 27 June 1612, \ntransferring to himself the copyright in the work. Six months later (2 January 1613) \nthe following agreement was entered in the unpublished Court-Book C (job): \u2018Mr. \nSamuel Dajfiiell. Yt is agreed that he shall deliii into the hall 200 plerlfect bookes. \nwhereof 40 be in thands of Wydowe Crosley of Oxon which the Compe shall receive \nof her as p[ar]cell of the said 200 books.

Also he promiseth that yf he mend or add any thinge to the book \nhereafter that then yt shalbe, prynted accordinge to thorder of the Comp*\"ie\u2019, Under \nthat arrangement apparently the present edition was issuedt. \nHowever, it appears to be the only one so published for Daniel obtained a patent for \nthis book, 11 March 1618, and the undated edition, the last published in his lifetime, \nwas privately printed by right of that privilege. The subsequent editions{{ were pub- \nlished by Waterson presumably by virtue of his entry which later was transferred to \nhis son John Waterson, 19 August 1635. \n{The British Museum copy appears to be on large-paper with crown watermark. \n{The copy for this edition was divided between Humphrey Lownes, sheets A-K; John Beale, sheets L-V; \nand William Jaggard, sheets X-Gg. Such division appears to have been a common, if not the normal, \n\npractice in books printed for the Company. \nHS.T.C. 6249 and 6250 are issues of the same edition.

The watermark in the present is a one-handled pot below a crescent \nwith the initials \u2018PR\u2019 above \u2018A\u2019 on the pot; that in the second issue is a unicorn. It has \nbeen stated that all copies which are dated 1601 were intended for presentation. Cer- \ntainly, all the copies so dated which we have examined are printed on large paper but \nwhether for presentation or not is doubtful. \nThere is a copy of this issue in the Bodleian which has substituted for the dedication \nto Elizabeth another, \u2018S.D. to his booke, in the dedicating thereof to the Librarie in \nOxford, erected by Sir Thomas Bodley\u2019, (two leaves, signed \u2018a\u2019, the verso of the second \nbeing blank). \nBoth copies in this collection and most other copies of both issues have the printed \ncancel-slip pasted over verses 7 and 8 of Musophilus, verso [As], restoring the correct \norder of these two lines which had been transposed in printing. \nWe have been able to trace only seven other copies of this issue, viz. the British \nMuseum (Corser), Bodleian (presentation), Huntington, Harvard (Clawson), Morgan, \nF.B.Bemis, and Tudor and Stuart Club Baltimore. \n\n}Sheets B through $ were, from the ornaments and manner of signing, printed by White; the remainder \n\nby Simmes. , \nthe Bemis copy of this issue in original calf is one-fourth inch taller than the present, as is also the Corser \n\ncopy in the British Museum. \nS.T.C. 6236.

The Waldron\u2014 \nPhilip Lord Hardwicke\u2014 Shakespeare Library (II, 1918, Lot 115) copy with Hardwicke book- \nplate. \n\nAN edition in octavot was published also dated 1651, but it would appear to be later \nthan the present because first, it was the usual practice that reprinted editions, if of a \ndifferent size and not elaborated in text or ornamentation, were compressed; second, \nthe octavo edition has appended a list of errata all but one of which are to be found in \nthe text of the quarto edition; third, it was the quarto edition which was acquired by \nThomason who did not ordinarily buy second editions; and finally, several presentation \ncopies of the quarto edition are known whereas only the Colonel Isham presentation \ncopy of the octavo can be traced and concerning it there is some doubtft. \nThe prefatory essay of the author and Hobbes\u2019s reply, together with the commenda- \ntory verses, were separately published under the title: \u2018A discourse upon Gondibert \n. with an answer to it by Mr. Hobbs, Paris, chez Matthieu Guillemot, 1650\u2019. It has \nsometimes been stated that that edition was actually printed in London but, although \nit was entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register, 15 February 1650, by Richard Mariott, there \nis no good reason for doubting the Paris printing, for the third Matthieu Guillemot was \nin business at Paris in 1650 and Davenant does not appear to have left that city until \nthe summer of that year. Furthermore, Thomason failed to include a copy in his collec- \ntions. \nSig [N4] and [Qq4] are said to be cancels in the Forman-R.B.Adam copy. In the pres- \nent Sig N2 and apparently [N4] are cancels, while Sig [Qq4] appears to be uncancelled. \nIt has not been possible to compare this copy with one having a variant state of these \nleaves although the W.A.White copy reads in the second line of stanza 89, verso [Qqa], \n\u2018Florift\u2019, in roman, while the present has that word in italic. The octavo 1651 edition \ngives \u2018Florift\u2019 in roman. Sig [Qq4] does not appear to be a cancel in the White copy. \n\n{The Ashley copy is described as being in original or early calf and yet is half an inch shorter and three- \nquarters of an inch narrower than the present; while the Heber-Britwell presentation copy, also in original \ncalf, measures a quarter-inch taller than the present. Since the Britwell copy is described as on \u2018Large \nPaper\u2019, the present copy may not improperly aspire to that distinction for the difference in the margins \nof the present and the Ashley copy, though not very great, is still a difference not likely to be due to the \nruthlessness of the binder. However, the C.K.Shorter copy in original morocco is said to be an eighth- \ninch taller even than the Britwell and we have seen half a dozen copies in early or contemporary calf and \nfind that all of them are very nearly the same size as the present so that if this is large-paper they are \nnot very rare, \n}For what is apparently an unique variant title of the octavo edition see Edward Almack Fine Old Bindings \np-76. \nH This last argument is not of any considerable weight except that it corroborates what one would naturally \nexpect.",

Miller acquired a volume which contained, besides the present, \nat least three other pieces by the same author, viz. Microcosmos 1603, Summa Totalis 1607, and \nHoly roode 1609, all now at Bexhill. These contained manuscript corrections which, either from \nexternal evidence such as binding or provenance, or from the nature of the corrections and the \nskill of penmanship with which they were made, enabled the Britwell librarian in the privately \nprinted catalogue of the English Poetry in that collection to note after each: \u2018the author\u2019s copy \nwith corrections in his autograph.\u2019 The collection was broken-up in 1870 by S.Christie-Miller and \nthe several pieces separately bound by Riviere in uniform red moroccof. The only manuscript \ncorrection in the present volume is on recto [C3] where the last word of the fifth line of the first \nstanza, \u2018farre\u2019 is crossed through and \u2018furre\u2019 (to rhyme with \u2018demurre\u2019 of the third line) carefully \n\nprinted in by pen. \n\nTue visit to England in 1606 of Christian IV, King of Denmark and brother of Queen \nAnne, made a tremendous sensation. He and his suite were most elaborately enter- \ntained by the English court, several dramatic productions being staged for their benefit \nas well as more formal entertainments. The poetasters, also, employed the event as an \nopportunity for setting forth some of their effusions}. \nFrom their ephemeral nature and slight format all of these pamphlets are quite rare; \nof the present, for example, only two other copies can be traced, both in public collec- \ntions, the Corser-Huth copy in the British Museum, and the Bridgewater in the \n\nHuntington Library. \ntIt is possible that the volume contained three other pieces although the authority quoted above does not \n\nsupport this supposition for the Britwell copies of Wities Pilgrimage (1605?], now Folger, Humours heau\u2019n \non Earth 1609, next number, and Muses-teares 1613 (unlocated) were all uniformly bound in red morocco \n\nby Riviere in the same year. a. , . \nICf.

It is believed that, as in a similar instance in the Davies Microcosmos 1603, these \ninitials may allude to William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage. \nThe present and both copies in the British Museum have manuscript marginal notes \non p.20 in a clear bastard hand referring to the asterisks in the text which the printer \nleft unsupplied. It is probable that they were written by someone in the printer\u2019s office \nrather than by Davies himself, cf. Bien venu. \nOnly four other copies can be traced. Two are in the British Museum, one the Gren- \nville with the author\u2019s autograph poetical dedication to the Earl of Northumberland, \nfather of the dedicatee, and a manuscript notef; one is at the University Library \nCambridge, and another in the Huntington Library (B.A.P.-Sykes-Corser-Huth). \n\nThe note reads: \u2018Through plrelcisenesse of the chaplaines allowed to allowe Bookes, (but I rather think \nthroughe ignorance, or causlesse feare) I could not gett this Epistle allowed, intending to have dedicated \n\nthis poore Poem to yo\" good Lo\u00ae so was faine to alt\" my purpose, and adresse it to yo\" son.\u2019 Henry Percy, \nninth or \u2018Wizard\u2019 Earl, was then in the Tower. \n\nS.T.C. 6332.

From the Shakespeare Library sale (1918, Lot 116). \n\nTHERE are two editions dated 1599. The first is known in two states. As originally set- \nup the sixteenth line of the tenth page of text reads: \u2018Which do by chaunge into our \nBodies flee.\u2019 \u2014\u2018chaunge\u2019 is there obviously an error. It was apparently found necessary \nto reset sheets A and C and the outer forme of sheet B, probably because of some mis- \ncalculation at the press. When those formes were reset the error was corrected to \n\u2018chaunce\u2019 (as in the present). The first state is of comparatively rare occurrence. Copies \nof both are at the British Museum and the Huntington Libraries. Before the year was \nout a paginary reprint was issued. The second edition may be distinguished by the \nreading of the same line for there the printer altered \u2018chaunce\u2019 to \u2018chance\u2019. \nThis justly celebrated poem is perhaps the only piece which may be cited in refuta- \ntion of the idea that reasoning in verse was not introduced into England until the time \nof Dryden. The dedication copy is at Holkham while a copy in original vellum which \nbelonged to the author is in the library of the late F.B. Bemis. Copies of this edition are \nnot uncommon, we have located over twenty and there are doubtless others. \n\nS.T.C. 6355. ARBER III. 142. HuNTINGTON C.L., 104. CoRSER Collectanea III, 104.

In the present, for \nthe first time, the poems are grouped by classes: canzonets, pastorals, odes, etc., prob- \nably by the publisher or his hack. The rearrangement, while a distinct improvement, \nwas carelessly done; the authors\u2019 names assigned in the editions edited by Davison are \nhere in most cases deleted, three poems are omitted which had appeared in the earlier \neditions and two new ones are added (verso A8), while many titles are altered and \nsome poems largely rewritten. \nThis anthology is the last of the Elizabethan \u2018song-books\u2019 and has been rated by \nseveral judges the finest of them all for it was edited by a poet who knew good poetry \nfrom that not so good. Nevertheless, it appears to contain some matter which was not \nselected by Davison for in the preface he states: \u2018If any except against the mixing (both \nat the beginning and end of this booke) of diuers things written by great and learned \nPersonages, with out [?our] meane and worthlesse scriblings, I vterly disclaime it, as \nbeing done by the Printer, either to grace the forefront with sir Philip Sidneys, and \nothers names, or to make the booke grow to a competent volume.\u2019. \nSeven other copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum (Brand), Bodleian (Ma- \nlone), Harmsworth (Freeling), Huntington (Farmer-Skegg-Utterson-Huth), Harvard \n(Gaisford-McKee-White), and two copies in original vellum, one in the library of Dr. \nRosenbach, the Warton-Fillingham-Caldecott-Britwell copy, and the other, with no \ntraceable provenance, recently in the possession of the W.H.Robinson Co. of Pall Mall. \n\n[ 260 ]\n\nWe have not been able to locate the Corser-Cosens-F.E.

Signature of Samuel Stillingfleet on title, \nThis copy apparently belonged to the father of Bishop Edward Stillingfleet, \u2018the beauty of holi- \nness\u2019, who was bishop of Worcester and author of the Origines Britannicae 1685, and whose books \nwere bought from his executors by Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop of Armagh. Whether this \nvolume was actually included among the books purchased by Marsh and transported to Dublin \ncannot be determined. Since for many years Marsh\u2019s library was the only public library in \nDublin it has suffered much from the depredations of book-thieves and it may be that this \nvolume was in the Marsh collection but was stolen from it before 1838. At any rate in that year \nwe pass from conjecture to fact for this copy was bequeathed with the rest of the library of John \nFitchett of Warrington to his nephew John Fitchett Marsh who disposed of his inheritance at \nSotheby\u2019s in 1882 where the present (Lot 672) was purchased by W.C. Hazlitt who evidently sold \nit privately to Frederick Locker\u2014 Lampson. The Rowfant Library already possessed the Chalmers \ncopy of the second issue and, since the variant imprint was either unnoticed or ignored, the pres- \nent copy was apparently set aside as a duplicate and so was not listed in the Rowfant Catalogue. \nHowever, this copy was of some interest to the author of The London Lyrics for he has written on \na flyleaf, still preserved facing the title, \u2018This Samuel Stillingfleet was the Father of my relative \nthe Bishopt{\u2014whose picture I have.\u2019, so that when the Rowfant Library was sold to Dodd \nMead & Co. in 1905 this volume with some others was retained and did not come upon the market \nuntil disposed of at Hodgson\u2019s (19 July 1922, Lot 556) by Commander Godfrey Locker\u2014 \nLampson. At the time of the sale this copy was bound in purple cloth with leather label on spine; \nwhen rebound one cover and the label were bound-in. \n\nTue second issue differs from the present in having Trundle\u2019s name omitted from the \nimprint. This was effected while the outer forme of the first sheet was in the press. That \nimprint reads: \u2018Imprinted at London, and are to bee | fold by Iohn Hodgets in Paules \nChurch- | yard. 1606. |\u2019.

The titles of the \ntwo issues, except for the imprints, are from the same setting. The imprint of the general \nissue reads: \u2018LONDON, | Imprinted by T.C. and are to be fold by John | Hodgets, at \nhis fhop in Paules Church- | yard, 1606. |\u2019. The private issue has an extra leaf, inserted \nfollowing the title, which contains Dekker\u2019s dedicatory sonnet to Sir Henry Cock, see \nPlate No.XI. \nThe priority of the general issue appears to be established as in it Sig A is integral \nand not a cancel. That leaf contains the dedicatory poem, \u2018To all the Nobility, Clergy, \nand Gentry Of Great Brittaine, True Subiects to King James\u2019, which was intended to \nbe set-up in columnar form. As originally set the line-endings are quite ragged, the \ncompositor not understanding his directions or misreading his copy. Consequently \nwhen the author had copies prepared for presentation this leaf was cancelled and a new \nsetting, with the typographical structure corrected, was struck-off and inserted in its \nplace. \nThis book was entered to Trundle and Edgar, gth December 1605, and although \nneither name appears in the published work, it is probable that they were the actual \nproprietors, Hodgets merely acting as agent. In this regard it may be noted that Edgar \nlater assigned a number of his copyrights, but not the present, to Hodgets, that Trundle \nentered for two other works by Dekker (The Dead Terme and Whore of Babylon) which \nwhen published did not bear his name, and that Hodgets\u2019 name appears in the imprints \nof four of Dekker\u2019s works (The Dead Terme {q.v.], Honest Whore (1st Part), Westward \nHoe {q.v.], and the present) although he apparently made no entry for any of them. \nThis singular work is a violent and somewhat fatuous attack upon papistry presum- \nably brought forth by the discovery of the Guy Fawkes Plot since it was entered the \nmonth following although the book itself contains no direct reference to that incident \n\nexcept, perhaps, the verses on \u201cThe Moldwarp\u2019, recto D2. \n\nis based upon the fact that a presentation copy in \nbe traced and it is not unlikely that Collier\u2019s auto- \nwith the printed dedicatory sonnet \n\n+Collier states that the ascription of this tract to Dekker \nDekker\u2019s autograph is known.

This latter was entered to Busby, 25th \nOctober 1608, and probably printed for him immediately thereafter for an edition dated \n1608 is extant in copies in the British Museum (imperfect), the Guildhall, and the \nBodleian. This part was also very popular, eventually even more editions of it were \npublished than of the first part, but whether this was due to the intrinsic interest of the \nvolume, the enterprise of the publisher, or the fact that in later editions it was some- \nwhat enlarged and issued under varying namest cannot now be determined. \nApparently the present is the only copy of this edition (there is one of the first) in \n\n}There is little reason to doubt that this was the Tite copy although it does not have his signature for that \ncopy was in red morocco by Bedford and was bought by Quaritch from whom Huth bought the present \nin 1875. Some pencil notes which may have been Tite\u2019s have been erased. ; \n}The edition of 1608 and the present one were all that were issued under the title of Lanthorne and candle- \nfight. In 1612 it was reprinted with an additional section which gave to that edition the name O per se 0, \nor a new cryer of lanthorne and candlelight. In 1616, it was considerably increased (a section Of a Prison \nand three new Canting Songs and \u2018The Bellman\u2019s Cry\u2019 being inserted), rearranged, and in some other \nrespects curtailed; that edition, as well as the reprints in 1620 and 1630, was entitled: \u2018Villainies discovered \nby lanthorne and candle-light\u2019. In 1632, the section \u2018Of a Prison\u2019 was omitted and five new chapters sub- \nstituted; it was then issued under the title \u2018English yillanies\u2019.

Anno.Dom.1604. with Licence.\u2019. \nThe edition which states that it is printed by Allde is no doubt the later of the two for \nnot only are the errors listed in the present, recto [I4], corrected in that text and the \nerrata list deleted; but it is a contracted reprint collating: A?, B-I*, even though, as \nstated on its title, it contains \u2018those speeches that before were publish\u2019t in Latin, now \nnewly set forth in English\u2019, viz. \u2018The Italians speech in English\u2019, 20 lines, and a trans- \nlation of the \u2018Sermo ad Regem\u2019, 52 lines, which are not included in the Creede edition \n\n{That title reads: \u2018The whole magnifycent entertainment . . . \u2019. The S.T.C. 6511 edition printed by E.Allde \n\nfor T.Man, presumably with title reading as in the present is a ghost; at least the copies listed in the $.T.C. \ndo not exist. \n\n[ 268 ]\n\nat allt. Moreover, it was the present title and not that used by Allde which was entered \nin the Stationers\u2019 Register by Man. Nevertheless, the Allde edition contains nearly \nhalf the original setting of the type of the Creede editiontf. \nFrom typographical evidence it can be demonstrated that the present edition was \ndivided among several shops\u00a7, as follows: sheets A-B, C-D, E, F-G, H, and I. From \nthe ornaments, it can be seen that sheets A-B were printed by Creede; sheet H, by \nLownes; and sheet I, at least as reimposed in the later edition, by Allde. The printers \nof sheets C-G cannot be identified but possibly some of them were the work of other \ncompositors in the shops named. They contain no ornaments. \nIf the number of booksta which the event called forth is a measure this entrance of \nKing James was one of the most \u2018magnificent\u2019 of all the early London pageants. \nDekker appears to have had a principal share in the preparation of the speeches given \nat the several halting places of the progress. He was assisted by Ben Jonson who wrote \nthe entertainment given at Fenchurch and at Temple Bar, and by Thomas Middleton \nwho wrote the lines spoken at the arch above the Conduit by W.Bourne. \nFrom the accounts for the proceeding of King James through London, 15th March \n1604, made by Sir George Home, Master of the Wardrobe (R.O. Lord Chamberlain\u2019s \nBooke 11.4(5), transcribed by Sir Edmund Chambers in his Shakespeare) it appears that \nShakespeare was in the procession following the King and that for the purpose he was \npresented with a piece of red cloth. \nIn a notice printed before the errata Dekker states: \u2018Reader, you must vnderstand, \nthat a regard, being had that his Majestie should not be wearied with teadious speeches: \nA great part of those which are in this Book set downe, were left vnspoken: So that thou \ndoest here receiue them as they should have bene deliuered, not as they were.\u2019. \nFor some reason copies of this edition are very much more common than are those of \neither of the other two; we have located no less than twenty-three copies and there are \nprobably others. \n\n}The Allde edition has, verso H-verso H2, an English translation of the oration delivered at St.Paul\u2019s School \nin place of the same in Latin which occupies those pages in the Creede. \ntiIn the Allde edition most of the content of sheets E, H, and I, of the inner formes of C, D, and G, with \nalterations, is from the original settings of the Creede edition, reimposed to allow for the additions inserted \nin the Allde. Lines 1-9 of verso I3 of the Allde edition were badly pied; the compositor pushed the loose \n\ntype back without regard to sense. . \n\u00a7In the Allde edition the division was apparently: sheets A-B, C-D, E-F, G, H, and I. Of these Allde printed, \n\nat least, A-B, and I. , \ntaB.Yon: his part of King Yames his royal entertainement (q.v.], is, in effect, a supplement to the present. \nOther books on this subject were written by Gilbert Dugdale (S.T.C. 7292), Stephen Harrison (12863) \n\nand John Savile (21784). \n\nS.T.C. 6510.

Apparently, however, this is in accordance with the facts for \nfrom such evidence as can be found the other variations have no temporal significance. \nThe present title is an example of the earliest state and may be distinguished by the \nfact that it mentions the performances at Whitehall and is dated 1656. The second is \nidentical with the first except that the date has been altered (query while in the press) \nto 1657. The third (presumably a cancel) reads: \u2018 . . . As it hath been often presented \nby their Majesties Servants, at the Cockpit in Drury Lane with great Applause . . . \n1657.\u2019 \nThis is one of that interesting class of books which have multiple dedications{ for \ncopies are found dedicated to the Earl of Southamptonf, e.g. the present; to Robert \nPierpont, Earl of Kingston, e.g. Malone 172 (1), to Lady Newton, e.g. the Dyce copy \n(according to Hazlitt that copy collates A-F*, but query); and to the Earl of Northum- \nberland, e.g. the Ashley copy. Since these four copies have the earliest title it would \nseem that the variant dedications were struck-off while the first sheet was still in the \npress. \nThis \u2018masque\u2019 has been identified with a play by Dekker called \u2018Phaethon\u2019 written \nin 1598. It was licensed in 1624, and included in the Cockpit lists of 1639. Scholars are \nnot agreed as to the amount of revision by Ford which this piece has undergone. \n\n{Regarding this practice see chapter from Dekker\u2019s Lanthorne and Candlelight reprinted in Censura Lit. V1, \n184, note by Collier Bid/. Acc. (Am. Ed.) I, 119, and examples listed by Corser Collectanea III, 159. \ntThere are two settings of this dedication. The Irwin-Morgan copy presents apparently the earlier with a \ntailpiece on verso. The present is entirely reset without any tailpiece. Except in the dedication to Lady \n\nNewton where alterations were made to fit the change in sex the text of the dedications is substantially \nthe same in all four forms. \n\nASHLEY Cat.

Little method can be observed in the \narrangement of the poems in the present edition. They are imperfectly grouped and \nthere is no attempt at chronological order. \nWe have located forty copies and others are recorded, but while this book cannot be \nsaid to be at all uncommon, its importance makes it a desirable item, especially in good \ncondition.

The William Collet \nof the Hale\u2014 Clawson (I, 1926, Lot 254) copy with bookplates. \n\nTHE poems included in this volume had been previously published. The Barrons Warres \nfirst appeared under the title \u2018Mortimeriados. The lamentable ciuell warres of Edward \n\nthe Second and the Barrons\u2019, \n\n1596. In that edition the poem was in stanzas of seven \n\nlines and was dedicated to Lucy, Countess of Bedford, but as reprinted in the present \n\n[ 290 ]\n\nthe dedication was omitted (as well as every allusion to her in the text) and the struc- \nture of the poem altered to stanzas of eight lines. At the same time the poem was \ndivided into six cantos witha short argument prefixed to each while throughout a num- \nber of passages were materially altered. \nEnglands Heroicall Epistles was first published in 1597, and again in 1598, 1599 [q-v.], \n1600, and 1602. On the 8th October 1602, Ling acquired from Lownes the copyright to \nthis work and, apparently at the same time, the unsold sheets of the 1602 edition}. He \nutilized the sheets of the text, ie. B-Q, by reissuing them in the present. But the pre- \nliminary matter, formerly a half-sheet, he reprinted on verso [L6]-verso [L8] of the \nBarrons Warres. \nIdea was originally published separately under the title \u2018Ideas Mirrour. Amours in \nquaterzains\u2019 1594, but as reprinted in the several editions of the Heroicall Epistles some \nof the sonnets were omitted and new ones added while a number of those which were \nretained were much altered and all were several times re-arrangedt. \nThis collected edition was reprinted (with the addition of the Legends which also had \nbeen previously published but were then re-written) under the title of Poems 1605. In \nthat edition the combination of pagination and foliation, for which in the present on \naccount of the use of the 1602 sheets of the Heroicall Epistles there was some excuse, \nwas blindly retained. In 1608 and 1610, the 1605 edition was reprinted, each time with \nthe same collation and contentsff. In 1613, a paginary reprint [q.v.] was again prepared \nwith two additional commendatory sonnets (by John Selden and E.Heyward) which \nwere printed as Sig [Ii8] but intended to be bound at the end of the preliminary leaves. \nSometime before 1620, probably circa 1616, an undated edition [q.v.] was published. \nIn 1620, Drayton superintended the publication of a considerably enlarged folio edition \n{q.v.] which was never wholly reprinted for the editions of 1630 and 1637 include only \nthe pieces in the earlier editions\u00a7. \nBesides the present copy eight others can be located, viz. British Museum (Bright), \nBodleian (Tanner), Huntington (Britwell), Harvard (?Lawrence-Lefferts), Folger, Tu- \ndor and Stuart Club Baltimore, Harmsworth, and a copy now owned by Bernard \nQuaritch. \n\n{Copies of the 1602 separate edition are in the British Museum, Trinity College Cambridge, Bodleian \n\n(Malone), and Harvard University Libraries. : \ntFor example, from a comparison of the text of the 1599 edition with that of the present, by means of the \n\nindex in the Appendix of Elton\u2019s Drayton (1905), it appears that there are nine sonnets in this edition \n\nwhich were not in the earlier one while another has been omitted. \u2014 ; / \nttSome copies of the 1610 edition, e.g. the British Museum and that described in the Grolier Club Collations \n\nhave had a leaf from the 1613 edition inserted in the preliminaries. , \n\u00a7These editions, however, present the text as altered and amended in 1619, for the dedicatory sonnet to \nSir Walter Aston which appeared in the earlier editions is replaced by the 1619 prose dedication and the \n\nLegend of Cromwell is appended. \n\nS.T.C. 7189.

However, while this edition \nwas being printed Drayton evidently determined to insert two commendatory sonnets \nwhich he had received from his friends, Selden and Heyward. Being a reprint, the \n\nVOL.I [ 297 ]\n\nprinter had presumably started setting-up the work with the preliminaries so, unless \nthe first half-sheet was to be discarded and set anew, his only recourse was to print \nthese sonnets on an extra leaf to be therein inserted. In the preceding editions Sig [Ii7 \nand 8] had been left blank and these leaves would here also have been unused had not \nthis need for an extra leaf arisen about the time that Stansby was nearing the end of \nthe book. By using Sig [Ii8] as the extra leaf he avoided having to run a single leaf \nthrough the press twice over. However, since he neglected to print on the leaf any \ndirections to the binder regarding its position, several copies, like the present, are \nknown with this leaf still an integral part of the last sheet. \n\nHuntineton C.L., 122. \nCorser Collectanea 111, 290. \n\nHoe Car.

The commendatory sonnets by Selden and Heyward were only in- \nserted in the 1613 edition at the last minute and appear there on the leaf printed as \n\n[ 298 ]\n\n(1i8] but intended to be inserted after [Ag]. In the present edition, however, these \nsonnets are incorporated as part of the preliminaries}. The text of the present edition \nis not that used in the revised folio edition of 1620 [q-v.] and hence presumably precedes \nit as the dated editions issued after the folio have the improved text. vP \n\nfIn order to accomplish this the first quire was a full-sheet instead of a half-sheet as in the 1613 and pre- \nceding editions. But since the additional matter filled only one leaf this left a surplus of three leaves which \nwas disposed of by the following re-arrangement: the first leaf was left blank, as also the versos of the \nsecond and third leaves, while the Address, which in the 1613 edition occupied only three pages, was \nspread out to fill five. The text of the earlier editions ended on verso [Ii6], the last two leaves of that thea \n(except [Ii8] in the 1613 edition for the reason noted above) being blank. Since Stansby here used a full- \nsheet for the preliminaries instead of a half-sheet as heretofore he decided to compress the \u2018Legend of \nGaveston\u2019 which comes at the end so that the last quire should occupy only a half-sheet instead of six \nleaves of a full-sheet. This he did by printing that Legend with five stanzas to the page instead of four \nand, since the rest of the volume is a paginary reprint of the 1613 edition, he was able by this means to \nuse exactly the same number of sheets in this edition as in the earlier ones although differently arranged \nat beginning and end. \n\nS.T.C. 7219.

This plate was used again in the Battaile of Agincourt 1627 [q.v.], and from the \ndate of the inscription may have been engraved, but was not apparently used, for the Poly- \nOlbion 1613. In some copies (e.g. Britwell 1922, Lot 246) this portrait is worked off on a separate \nleaf and not on the reverse of the title. It is possible, of course, that such copies have had this \nleaf inserted from The Battaile of Agincourt and it is also possible, though we have not been able \n\nto examine copies for confirmation, that those impressions were printed on larger-paper. \n\nFirst Epition.

Though this is heresy, it is not unlikely \nthat the one dated 1620 is the earliest. The tradition that copies with the undated \ngeneral-titles were issued in \u2018[1619]\u2019 has apparently no other basis than that the section \ntitles are so dated. However, so far as we have observed the 1620 general-title does not \noccur in copies in original condition which are bound with The Battaile of Agincourt \n1627. The two books frequently occur together and, though it is not known under what \ncircumstances they were issued, it is not unlikely that the remainder copies of this book \nso used were given an undated title as a matter of policy. Moreover, though this has \nnot been confirmed by an exhaustive examination, it is probable that the setting of the \ngeneral-title which is without Smethwick\u2019s device and address, e.g. the Herbert-Douce \ncopy, is the one designed for use in such copies. In any case, that setting is closer in \ntypographical arrangement to the 1620 title than is the \u2018third\u2019 general-title, of which \nthe present is an example. If the preceding conjectures are correct, this title was affixed \nto such of the remainder copies as were not disposed of wholesale for issue with the \nBattaile of Agincourt. \nWe cannot give any very logical account concerning the presence or absence of the \nengraved title and portrait. Presumably the latter in copies intended to be bound with \nthe Battaile of Agincourt was superfluous. Moreover, there can be no doubt that the \nengraved title was sometimes printed on a separate sheet from the letterpress title and \nan impeccable copy now in the possession of Quaritch is without the engraved title and \nportrait but has the \u2018third\u2019 setting of the general-title conjugate with a genuine blank. \nThis volume is not simply a reprint of the earlier volumes of Poems and Poemes \n\n[ 300 ]\n\nlyrick and pastorall together with The Owle, though it contains them all \n\n: for Drayton \nrevised and augmented the work here printed so that it re a \n\nmecaeaty f \u2018presents what may be called \nthe \u2018definitive\u2019 text of nearly all his previously published poems except Poly-Olbion \nPart I. , \n\nLarge and thick-paper copies are known which are nearly an inch and a half taller \n\nthan the present although this was considered of sufficient size to be described in the \nMcKee catalogue as \u2018Large Paper\u2019. \n\nS.T.C. 7222, HunTincTon C.L., 122.

The Locker\u2014 \nChew\u2014 Huntington (1X, 1918, Lot 203) copy with Locker 1874 bookplate and Chew leather \nlabel. \n\nA Few undated copies were issued in 1612 without a printed title or Table and with the \nplates in the first state. In 1613, a printed titleft was inserted between the frontispiece \nsheet and the dedication in the position occupied by the present title. The quire con- \ntaining the Table was also added at that time. Copies of these eighteen songs which \noccur without the second part in early or original bindings are usually of that second \nissue. In 1622, the unsold copies of this first part were acquired by the publishers of \nthe second part and reissued with a general-title, as above. \nIn both the first and second issues the final sheet is mis-signed \u2018D\u2019 and the word \n\u2018FINIS.\u2019 occurs between a headpiece (McK. and F.n.183) and tailpiece (McK. and \nF.n.186) on p.303. In the third issue, which has the 1622 general-title, the signature is \ncorrected to \u2018Dd\u2019 and \u2018FINIS.\u2019 is omitted. The final sheet is, however, otherwise from \nthe same setting. This indicates, apparently, that before the type for that sheet was \ndistributed it was decided that some copies should be kept aside to be issued with copies \nof the second part which Drayton then hoped would soon be ready for the press. \nMatthew Lownes\u2019 part of the copyright apparently was retained intact and may be \ntraced in the Stationers\u2019 Register (Arber IV.177, 185, and 205). The syndicate which \npublished the second part presumably, therefore, merely acquired the unsold copies of \nthe first part. \nIn the address \u2018To any that will read it\u2019 of Part I], Drayton complains that the \nstationers \u2018haue either despightfully left out, or at least carelessly neglected the Epistles \n\nCopies are known which are an inch taller than the present. \nHH This 1613 title, a copy of which is inserted in the present, reads: POLY-OLBION. | or | 4 Chorographicall \nDefcription of Tracts, Rivers, | Mountaines, Forefts, and other Parts of this renowned I/le | of Great Britaine, | \nWith intermixture of the moft Remarquable Stories, Antiquities, Wonders, | Rarityes, Pleafures, and Com- \nmodities of | the fame: | Digested in a Poem | By | MICHAEL DRAYTON, | Zfg. | With a Tadle added, \nfor direction to thofe occurences of Story and Antiguitie, | whereunto the Courfe of the Volume eafily \n\nleades not. | {printer's device, McK.n.149] | LONDON. | Printed by H.L. for Mathew Lownes: I.Browne: \nJ.Helme, | and I.

When he set about reprinting the non-dramatic poems, he decided to append \nto this reprint of the Annus Mirabilis several of the smaller pieces listed br He \ndiscovered, however, after some copiest of the first sheet were printed that he still had \non hand copies of the second, 1685, edition of Dryden\u2019s elegy, T\u00e9renodia Augustalis. \nHe therefore caused the printer to omit the sixteenth line of the title, re-lead the lower \npart, and, of course, not include the elegy in the text. Copies of the second edition of \nthe Threnodia were still available, in 1693, for the fourth volume of Tonson\u2019s Works of \nMr. Fohn Dryden. \n\n{The only copy which we have found, other than the present Dormer copy, is that described by Hazlitt \nIII, 290. We have seen, or found described, seven other copies with the title in later state. \n\nHoe Car. II (1903) 120. Grorier CLus Dryden Cat. No.25.",

The third, published by Hindmarsh, collates: A-H*, [-]'. \nRoper entered for this book, 4th April 1691, and later the same year was sued by the \nauthor for payment (see Plomer Dictionary 1668-1725, p.257). The result of the suit is \nnot known but presumably Hindmarsh\u2019s edition has some connection with it. \nAccording to Nicoll this play was one of the first of that period to \u2018exhibit an interest \nin \u201clocal colour\u201d \u2019.

Sold Shakespeare Library, I, 1918, Lot 338. This is presumably \nthe copy sold at Bool\u2019s sale in 1903 which was resold at auction in 1904, 1905 and 1906. \n\nIn all the later editions a number of passages were omitted so that this first is the only \ncomplete edition until Croft\u2019s 1880 reprint of the present text. This circumstance is of \nconsiderable importance as may be seen by the footnotes in Croft\u2019s edition where the \nomissions are pointed out. \nThis book is not only the earliest treatise on moral philosophy in English but the \nfirst of an imposing array which introduced into England the cultural and political \nideals of the Renaissance. Elyot\u2019s purpose was not so much to set forth his ideas of \npolitical economy, as \u2018to instruct men in such vertues as shall be expedient for them \n\nwhiche shall haue auctoritie in a weale publike\u2019}. \n\nOnly six other copies can be located, viz. the British Museum (Grenville, imperfect), \nCambridge (imperfect), Harmsworth (Sotheby 1916), Huntington (Herbert-Britwell), \nYale (imperfect), and the Morgan (Irwin). \n\nAmong the English sixteenth century books which sought to attain this same end, many strongly influenced \nby the present work, were those of Ascham, Barckley, Bryskett and Lawrence Humphrey as well as the \nanonymous Institution of a gentleman 1555, the Basilikon Doron, and the works of Cleland, Peacham and \nSegar. Translations of works of similar content were even more numerous; among these may be mentioned \nthose of Cardano, Casa, Castiglione, Coignet, Du Vair, Machiavelli (if only through Gentilet), Mornay, \n\nNanini, Patrizi and Primadaye. \n\nS.T.C. 7635.

Sold Shakespeare \nLibrary, II, 1918, Lot 117. \n\nBerore this edition was completely printed the demand, or perhaps the publisher\u2019s \nestimate of the demand, induced him to have that portion of the volume which had \nbeen printed and the type distributed reset so that there are copiesf in which sheets \nA-E, as well as verso F and recto F2 are from an entirely different setting from that of \nthe present}. That setting may be easily distinguished from the present by the presence \non the title of a scroll-ornament with dolphins and crowned fleur-de-lis and thistle, \ninstead of the royal arms. \nApparently this is not an ordinary case of simultaneous printing but was the result of \ncontinuing demand for in the six copies examined not only were the two settings of \nthose sheets which were reprinted kept distinct, but it can be shown that one setting \nwas composed from the other. This last appears from the fact that lines nine and ten of \nverso E3 in the present issue read by dittography\u2018 . . . not to| to print . . . \u2019, whereas \nin the other issue they read \u2018. . . not to| print . . . \u2019, That issue is a correction of \nthe present as the compositor of the second issue left a double space when he omitted \nthe second \u2018to\u2019. \nThere are numerous other differences between the two settings, e.g. the compositor \nof the later setting used capitals much more frequently than the compositor of the \nearlier. But the main difference is that in the present the proem setting forth the cir- \ncumstances which necessitated this decree was printed in italic continuously with the \npreliminary seal of approval and order for printing, while in the later it is separated, \nprinted in roman, and begins on recto [Aq] with ornaments at top. \nThe present is the fourth of the Star Chamber ordinances regulating printing, not \ncounting James\u2019s proclamation of 1633 which confirmed the decree of 1586. It reafirms \nthe former decrees and ordinances, but with additions and alterations, and was drawn \n\ntCopies of the second issue are in the Chapin Library, the Grolier Club, and at the Rosenbach Company. \n}The inner forme of sheet G had evidently been taken out of the chase, but as the type had not been dis- \ntributed it was not necessary to reset it. However, the catchwords on verso G and recto G2 were altered. \n\n[ 338 ]\n\nup by the Lord Keeper, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, the Lord \nTreasurer, the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chief Baron, was produced in the Court \nby the Attorney General, and received the approval of the Court and its order for \nprinting. It differs from the earlier decrees mainly in the restrictions which it placed \nupon the number of printers and founders permitted and the limitation.of apprentices \nand presses allowed to each, but its effectiveness was seriously impaired by the abolition \nof the Court by act of Parliament, 1640. \nThis decree has been several times reprinted, once by Hollis, again in Arber\u2019s Tran- \nscript of the Stationers Registers 1V.528, and also for the Grolier Club, 1885. \n\nS.T.C. 7757.

Black Letter. \nCotiation: A*; A-T4; 80 leaves. \n\nContents: title, recto [A]; verso blank; To the reader, recto A2-recto [Aq]; blank, verso [Aq]; \ntext, recto A (repeated)-verso T3; colophon, recto [T4]; printer\u2019s device, McK.n.80, verso (T4]. \n\nEarly nineteenth century citron straight-grain morocco, gilt and blind-tooled. 734 x 534 inches. \nThe Tite (1874, Lot 1028) \u2014Lefferts (1902, Lot 546) \u2014 Hagen (1918, Lot 487) copy with book- \nplates, and Tite signature dated 1858. \n\nTue second edition is dated on title and colophon as above, error and all, but it was \nreally printed about 1560. From the fact that it is a paginary reprint with the same \ntitle-compartment it is sometimes confused with the present. However, the two editions \nmay be easily distinguished by variant readings of their titles (e.g. \u2018latine\u2019 in the fourth \nline of the present reads \u2018latyne\u2019 in the other) and by the fact that the last page of the \nother is blank, lacking Berthelet\u2019s device. In the second edition the initials below the \ncompartment are \u2018TP\u2019 instead of \u2018TB\u2019 and belong to Thomas Powell, Berthelet\u2019s suc- \ncessor and the printer of that edition despite the colophon attribution to Berthelet. \nThat evidence alone is sufficient to date that edition after 1555. A comparison of the \ntexts shows that in the Powell edition the spelling is consistently simplified, \u2018i\u2019 being \nfrequently substituted for \u2018y\u2019, and many errors of the present edition are there corrected. \nCopies of both editions are in the British Museum, the Huntington, and the Chapin \nLibraries; neither is particularly uncommon. \nIt may seem strange that this book which was printed on the continent some forty \ntimes before the death of the author and which, from the circumstances under which \nit was written and the person to whom it was dedicated, would appear to be peculiarly \nEnglish, was not printed in England, even in the original Latin, until this present trans- \nlation was issued. However, the fact that, unlike the Narrenschiff and some of the other \nsimilar works of that time, this book was addressed to the learned or at least written by \na humanist who was not much interested in the unlearned, probably accounts for the \ncircumstance that it was not translated earlier into the English vernacular}. Further- \nmore since at that time there was little regulation preventing the importation (in sheets \nand in gross) of foreign-printed Latin books into England and since English scholars \npreferred books printed by Badius Ascensius and the other learned printers of the \ncontinent there was no inducement for the English tradesmen to print it themselves. \n\n{It has since been translated into nearly all the languages of Europe.

However, the \nfact that the general-titlet is the only \u2018link\u2019 in the first part of the volume indicates a \nchange of plan after the Catiline was set-up. \nThe printer of this volume has not been identified\u2014 Walley despite the colophon \nbeing only the publisher\u2014but as there are numerous blocks and initials it is not likely \nthat he will always remain unidentified. \nPaynell claims in his dedication to the Fugurth to have perused and amended Bar- \nclay\u2019s text which \u2018thorough vnlearned correctors\u2019 was \u2018somewhat mangled and cor- \nrupted\u2019.

In the \nsecond edition, 1639, this phrase was retained and amplified by the further note that \nthis play contained the \u2018merry prankes of Moll Cut-Purse\u2019. \nCopies of this issue are very uncommon, the only copies which can be traced are the \nBritish Museum (Halliwell), Dyce, Huntington (Devonshire), Folger (Huth), Hogan \n(Fenn-Frere-Adams), and the Stanley-Blandford-Britwell copy which now belongs to \nMaggs Bros. \n\ntSee Garnier Cornelia 1594. \n{The only copy which can be traced with this cancel title is the Hoe-Huntington. Some question has been \nraised as to it being genuine, and an examination of a photostat appears to give some slight support to \nsuch suspicions. However, a photostat is not a satisfactory medium for such investigations and it seems \nto us that it is a remarkable instance of restraint on the part of a forger that if he manufactured this title \nwith the second edition before him he did not insert a reference to Moll Cut-Purse also. \n\nS.T.C, 10851.

At any rate, later when \nhe transferred his rights to Moseley, 22nd February 1648, this play was listed as \u2018by Mr \nBeamont & Fletcher\u2019 and was published in the same year as \u2018Written by John Fletcher \nGent.\u2019.

At end, \nan unidentified sixteen-pointed orange sticker. \n\nSome copies were issued on large and thick paper and with copper-plates which do not \noccur in the ordinary ones. Since these plates, as noted below, all refer to Edward \nBenlowes and since all the large-paper copies in original binding which can be traced \nbear his super-libris they are usually described as being dedication copies. Whether they \nare or not cannot be determined although it is more likely that they belong to a special \nissue which was prepared for presentation by Benlowes(!) somewhat as in the case of \nhis Theophila, several copies of which are extant with his arms on their sides. \nThe three plates found in the large-paper issue are: 1. Engraved coat of arms of \nBenlowes and Fletcher (?Quarles), on verso of general-title; 2. Engraved verses signed \n\u2018p.F.\u2019 on the anagram \u2018Edward Benlowes: Sun-warde beloved\u2019, on recto unsigned leaf \nconjugate with title-leaf of the Piscatorie eclogs; and 3. Engraved plate dedicated \n\u2018Charifsimo E.B. P Fletcher\u2019 with printed verses below, on recto of unsigned leaf \n\n{The break in the signature sequence and the corresponding gap in the pagination are apparently the result \nof miscalculation when the copy was divided between compositors. The signatures of M3 and 4 indicate \nthat the error was noticed. \n}Of these, the Sykes-Britwell copy now in the possession of Maggs Bros., and the F.T.Sabin copy in the \nMorgan Library are particularly interesting because they both contain an inscription in the hand of the \nauthor which reads: \u201cBenevolus Esse suj voluit monumentu[m] & pignus Amoris\u2019. Moreover, the Sykes- \nBritwell copy has Benlowes\u2019 arms on sides and the Morgan copy, though rebound, retains the original calf \nupper-side containing the same armorial stamp. The Lefferts-Bement copy, in the Widener collection at \nHarvard, on the other hand, is in the original purple calf with Benlowes\u2019 arms, and there is at least one \nother copy in original calf with the same arms impressed on sides, namely the copy sold at Anderson\u2019s 9 \nFebruary 1920. Large-paper copies are also to be found in the British Museum (two copies, one certainly, \nand both probably, originally bound with Benlowes\u2019 arms on sides) and the Huntington Library while \nseveral others, all except the Hoe-Jones-McVickers copy rebound, are recorded. Such copies generally \nmeasure an inch more in height than the present and the paper has a faint fleur-de-lis watermark. \n\n[ 360 ]\n\ninserted after Sig G3 (p.54) of the Piscatorie eclogs.

It was the second library \ngathered by a Bruce. The first, collected by Robert, first Earl of Ailesbury (d.1685) was sold in 1687 \nas the library of Lord Burghley because it contained MSS., including some recently in the Mostyn col- \nlection, which the Earl had acquired through his wife, Lady Diana Grey, who was the great-great-grand- \ndaughter of Cecil.

There is, however, no record of any edition published by him, or that he trans- \nferred his rights to Blount, who entered it independently 4 June 1600. \nThere is considerable evidence, for example Cornwallis\u2019s Essays 1601, Essay 12, that \nsome translation, if not this one, possibly one in manuscript was known in literary \nLondon several years before the present edition was publishedfa. This is of considerable \nimportance for, since it is generally accepted that Shakespeare used Florio\u2019s translation \nwhen writing the passage on a natural commonwealth in his Tempest, which is a late \nplay, the fact that he was familiar with Florio\u2019s work in that instance lends credibility \nto other, though less definite, parallelisms even in those plays written before this book \nwas published, particularly in the case of Hamlet. \nFor a book of such literary importance this is, next to the First Folio of Shakespeare, \none of the commonest volumes of the period. That is not particularly remarkable con- \nsidering the size but it is perhaps worthy of note that an unusually large number of \ncopies are still preserved in original calf, morocco or vellum. We have seen some seven- \nteen such copies, for the most part in private collections, and there are doubtless others. \n\ntaFor discussions of this point see P.M.L.A.

The first part, \nAmyntas, is a close translation, as far as Act V,Sc.ii, of Tasso\u2019s Aminta, acted at \nFerrara in 1573 (but see Greg Pastoral Poetry and Anglia XI, 1889, p.11). \nThe paraphrase of Watson\u2019s Amyntas, here entitled \u2018Phillis Funeral\u2019, was previ- \nously published as The Lamentations of Amyntas. In this the eleventh eclogue of the \nearlier editions has been divided into two and there are other alterations. The Lamen- \ntation of Corydon is a translation of Virgil\u2019s second Eclogue and had previously ap- \npeared in Fraunce\u2019s Arcadian Rhetoricke and was included in some copies of his Law- \nters Logike. \nThe title \u2018Yuychurch\u2019 is derived from the name of one of the dedicatee\u2019s Welsh resi- \ndences. The dedication itself is an important document in the history of the school \nwhich sought to naturalize classical metres in English verse. \nThe first and second parts of the Yuychurch were entered and presumably published \nat the same time as Fraunce\u2019s Emanuel (q.v.] with which they frequently occur bound \nin early or contemporary state. The two were probably sold as one book for the fee \npaid in making entry was that which was customary for a single title and the slight- \nness of the Emanuel, a scant twenty leaves, would make it anomalous in that day \nwhen books were usually classed according to size instead of individual intrinsic worth. \nS.T.C. 11340.

At any rate, during the greater part of the nineteenth century it was generally \nbelieved that the Herbert-Roxburghe-George III copy in the British Museum was the \nonly perfect one in existence. However, since that time several others have come to \nlight including the present which is probably the finest of them all though a Huntington \ncopy bound in early vellum with Fenton\u2019s Monophilo 1572, runs a close second; the \nAmpthill-Chew copy, now in the library of Dr. Rosenbach, is also in original vellum \nbut is not otherwise immaculate. Other perfect copies are the Harvard (Huth-White), \nand the Harmsworth (Britwell, 1924). Imperfect copies are in the British Museum \n(Garrick), the Huntington (Heber (IV, Lot 745)-Gaisford-Chew), the Chapint (Far- \nmer-Park-Hill-B.A.P.-Midgley-Heber (VIII, Lot 960)-Jolley-Corser-Paine-Sotheby \n1892-Locker-R.J.Collier-Steeves-Groves), and the Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington \ncopy sold in 1918 but now untraced. \n\nfit is possible that the change in publishers may account for the rarity of this volume for probably a number \nof copies of this part were thus sold to purchasers who did not already have the other parts and so, on \naccount of bearing on their titles the stigma of incompleteness, were lightly regarded. \n}The story of the wanderings and separations of this and its companion volume is somewhat romantic for \nthey have been across the Atlantic three times, separated three times by the vicissitudes of the auction \nroom, and rebound three times, all within the last hundred and forty years. \n\nS.T.C. 11341.

Besides these there were several \nprinted on the continent and particularly at Heidelberg. But, except for John Taylor's \ndescription of the fireworks, the present is the only one which describes the actual cere- \nmony of the marriage on 14th February 1613. \nBesides the accounts which have survived is an almost equal number, eleven to be \nexact, which were entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register and presumably printed. The \nmajority of these were ballads.

Oldys mentions that it had been recently printed and one of the British \nMuseum copies (613.1.8) has written in an eighteenth century hand: \u2018this index was \nfirst published in the year 1744\u2019. However, it does not appear to have been noticed \nthat there are at least two editions of this index. The present, which from its irregu- \nlarities appears to be the earlier, may be identified by having as a headpiece on p.(1] \nan ornament of flowers and seeds. The other edition has a headpiece of interlaced lines. \nAccording to Hazlitt this index was prepared for Lilly while Quaritch\u2019s General Cat. \nX (1884) No.22766 attributes it to Triphook.
