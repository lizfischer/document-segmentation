The last is perhaps a made-up copy. There are two imperfect \ncopies (Garrick and George III) in the British Museum which may be of this issue. \n\n#This block was used by Edward Allde from 1593 to 1599. There is little room for doubt, however, that \nthis volume was printed by Roberts for not only does it contain ornamental initials known to be his but \nit is signed in his manner. In the year this was printed Allde and Roberts were associated in printing an \nedition of Daniel's Delia and the following year Roberts used Allde\u2019s Diana headpiece in an undated \nedition of Lyly\u2019s Euphues. \n$A discussion of this movement is to be found in the introduction to Kastner and Charlton\u2019s edition of the \nPoetical Works of William Alexander. \n\nS.T.C. 11622.

Sixteenth century \nsignature of Wyllyam Romney. \n\nTue first part of this book, Sig A-Es, is a literal translation of the Latin text of the three \nparts of the De contemptu mundi sive de miseria humanae conditionis of Lotario Conti, \nPope Innocent III, the following three chapters only being omitted in the English: Iv \nQuali cibo conceptus nutriatur in utero; W.xxiv De coitu contra naturam; I1Liv De poenis \ninferni diversis. It is perhaps merely a coincidence that in the same year that the present \nwas printed another translation, by Henry Kerton, was publishedt. But it is probably \nnot due to coincidence that in neither case was the name of the author of the original \ngiven. In the dedication of the present Gascoigne says that he translated from a copy \n\u2018so torne, as it neyther had the beginning perspicuous nor the end perfect\u2019 so that he \ncould not \u2018certaynly say, who shuld be the Author of the same\u2019, but it is not at all \nunlikely that both Kerton and Gascoigne omitted the name of the author for reasons of \nprudence rather than ignorance. \nThe crude woodcut on recto [D8] is probably a copy of one in the Latin edition from \nwhich Gascoigne translated. It shows sinners being hurled into the fires of Hell by \nfrightful devils and is entitled: \u2018{ Of the vnspeakeable perplexitie of the damned\u2019. \n\nFour editions of Kerton\u2019s version were published\u2014an unrecorded one of 1580 has recently been acquired \nby the British Museum, \n\nS.T.C. 11641.

The commendatory verse by Raleigh is believed to be his \nearliest published poem. \nIt should be observed that the dedication to the Steele Glas is dated 15 April 1576, \nwhile the dedication to Phylomene is dated 16 April 1575. This latter date, considering \nthat Gascoigne was rather careless in such matters (see Posies 1575), would appear to \nbe an error for 1576, except that in the note at the end of the volume Gascoigne writes: \n\u201cAnd thus my very good L. may se how coblerlike I haue clouted a new patch to an \nolde sole, beginning this cdplainte of Philomene, in Aprill, 1562. continuing it a little \nfarder in Aprill.1575 and now thus finished this thirde day of Aprill.1576. At which \nmine April showers are humbly sent ynto your good Lordship . . . \u2019. From this, as \nwell as from the wording of the dedication itself, it is quite possible that the Phylomene \ndedication was written as dated, at the time when Gascoigne continued the poem \u2018a \nlittle farder in Aprill.157s\u2019. Not being immediately printed Gascoigne could not for- \nbear \u2018finishing\u2019 the poem with several pages of moralizing lines to which he appended \nthe explanatory note quoted above, but did not trouble to rewrite the dedication. \nMore interesting, perhaps, than the question of the date of this dedication is the \nchallenge which it contains: * . . .

The first part, Sig Bg-X*, contains \nthe comedy Supposes, translated from Ariosto into prose by Gascoigne, and the tragedy \nFocasta, translated from Dolce (not from Euripides as claimed on title) by Gascoigne \nand Francis Kinwelmershe. This section appears to have been originally intended to be \n\n[ 388 ]\n\nissued separately for not only has it a separate signature-sequence but the colophon on \npage 164 is otherwise inexplicable. The cancelled leaves, Sig B1-2, according to such an \nhypothesis, probably contained the dramatis personae, argument, and separate title to \nthe Supposes and would perhaps, if this portion had actually been separately issued, \nhave been preceded by preliminaries containing a general-title and dedication. \nThe concluding portion of the volume which from the fact that it contains, counting \nthe lyrics in the Adventures of Master F.1., exactly one hundred poems (see Haslewood \nreprint 1926 p.198) gives the volume the title \u2018A Hundreth sundrie Flowres\u2019. This \nportion is also a distinct unitt. It is not only separated from the other part bibliogra- \nphically but appears to have been considered by the editort as the complete work for \nthe letter \u2018H.W. to the Reader\u2019 (pp.201-2), \u201cThe letter of G.T. to his very friend H.W. \nconcerning this worke\u2019 (pp.202-5), as well as the address \u2018The Printer to the Reader\u2019 \n(recto A2-recto [A3]), which were all probably written by the same hand (Trans. VII, \n1926, p.274) and certainly before any of this copy came to the printer, refer to this \nportion of the volume alone. Indeed, in \u2018The Printer to the Reader\u2019 which occurs in the \ngeneral preliminary leaves of the volume, as printed, we read: \u2018Master H.VV. in the \nbeginning of this worke, hath in his letter (vvritten to the Readers) . . . And nexte \nvnto that learned preamble, the letter of G.T. . . . \u2019. But these letters do not occur at \nthe \u2018beginning of this worke\u2019 unless by that one refers not to the volume as published \nbut merely to the latter portion containing the \u2018Flowres\u2019 proper. \nFrom the foregoing one may conjecture that the history of the publication of this \nvolume was somewhat as follows: sometime either about the end of 1572 or very early \nin the following yeartt, Richard Smith set about the publication of Gascoigne\u2019s trans- \nlations of the Suppositi and the Giocasta, the printing of which he entrusted to Bynne- \nman. About the time when this undertaking was nearing completion, but presumably \nbefore any copies were actually issued, someone brought to Smith a manuscript entitled \n\nJust why the pagination of this portion begins with number \u2018201\u2019 cannot be entirely explained either by \nthe present hypothesis or by any other which we have considered. The paper used in both portions has \nthe same watermark so that both were probably printed in the same shop (the type and initials appear to \nbe Bynneman\u2019s throughout) although the fact that the fourth leaf is signed in a number of sheets in the \nbeginning of the latter portion but not in the other may indicate, together with some other changes of \ntypographic style more or less related to the difference in content, that the copy was given to different \ncompositor. But the fact remains that the pagination of the latter portion begins with\u2019 \u2018zor\u2019 which \nmakes a gap of 36 numbers which can be explained only as an error due to carelessness (similar to the gap \nafter p.36 of the Supposes) if, as is conjectured above, this portion was set-up after the plays were printed- \noff, On the other hand, if the gap in pagination (36 pages, two and a half sheets) is the result of the \nomission of other matter, why does the signature-sequence of this part begin with Sig A? \nWho this may have been cannot now be determined. The editor refers to himself by the initials H.W. and \nstates that he received the manuscript from his friend G.T, and gave it to A.B. to print but all of these \ninitials are probably fictitious. For an interesting attempt to explain some of the problems regarding the \nauthorship and publication of this volume, see B.M.Ward\u2019s introduction to Haslewood\u2019s reprint 1926, \nW.W.Greg's review, Trans. VII (1926) 269, Ward's reply, RE.S. 1V, 35, and 7.L.8. 1 July 1926. \ntthe absence of entries of copy in the Stationers\u2019 Register from 22 July 1571 to 17 July 1576, deprives us \nof the possibility of securing external evidence regarding this book. \n\nVOL.IT [ 389 ]\n\n\u201cA Hundreth sundrie Flowres\u2019 which contained a considerable amount of. material which \nwas there attributed to \u2018sundry Gentlemen\u2019 besides other pieces ascribed to Gascoigne \nand some without any indication of authorship. Prefixed to this manuscript were the \nvarious letters and addresses noted above which were all probably written by the person \nwho edited the manuscript and passed it over to be published. Smith, however, instead \nof publishing this manuscript separately, decided to combine the two. This he did by \nthe somewhat violent means described above, giving the combined work the title which \nreally only applies to the latter portion, placing \u2018The Printer to the Reader\u2019 address \nwhich belongs with the Flowres portion, at the beginning of the volume, and including \nthe two plays in the list of contents on the verso of the title. Very likely Smith had \nintended to issue the Supposes and Jocasta under Gascoigne\u2019s name but as the Flowres \nmatter, in the copy which he used, was in part ascribed to others, he avoided the issue \nby making no mention of authorship on the title of the volume as issued and giving to \nGascoigne all the credit which the manuscript granted to him in the list of contents on \nthe verso. The result is that this volume has the appearance, and may in fact be (see \nWard op. cit.) one of the earliest of the Elizabethan anthologies. \n\u2018This book, some fifteen copies of which are all that we have been able to trace, is of \nimportance because it contains the first printed work of Gascoigne, because the Sup- \n\u2018poses is the earliest known comedy in English prose and the Yocasta the second earliest \ntragedy in English blank verse, and because it is of Shakespearean interest, though \nrather slight. Nashe, in Greene\u2019s Menaphon, says of Gascoigne that it was he \u2018who first \nbeat the path to that perfection which our best poets have aspired to since his departure\u2019. \n\nS.T.C, 11635.

The Caldecott (1833, Lot 432)\u2014Britwell (1924, Lot \n341) copy. \n\nTuis edition is usually denominated the \u2018first authorized edition\u2019. It differs materially \nfrom the first edition [q.v.], also published by Smith, being entirely rearranged and \ndivided into three parts\u2014 Flowers, Hearbes, and Weedes. Some pieces which occurred \nin the earlier edition are omitted, one piece reappears here twice, one has been altered \nalmost beyond recognition, and still others are inserted for the first time. The whole \ntext of the present appears to have been edited by Gascoigne who has added some and \nomitted other marginal notes, deleted or altered much of the editorial matter of the \nlatter portion of the first edition, corrected the metre in places, and even inserted new \nlines (e.g. fol.85 (recto H3) of the Iocasta, lines 29-31). This does not mean that the text \nof this edition is throughout superior to that of the first for it is not\u2014the compositors \nhaving introduced the usual proportion of corruptions generally to be found in a text \nset-up, as is the present, from an earlier printed one. \nThere are many problems connected with this book, regarding the authorship of some \nof the pieces, the changes made in the text, the identification of persons mentioned, \netc., which have not been settled and will not, if ever, until someone studies all of \nGascoigne\u2019s work minutely. For a very interesting contribution, see Leicester Bradner \nThe First English Novel (P.M.L.A. XLV (1930) $43). A Brown University thesis by \nP.M.Chalmers endeavors to show that Gascoigne\u2019s rearrangement of this edition was \nmade partly in accordance with the subjects of the several pieces, partly according to \ntheir metre, and partly in order to equalize the length of the sections. \nSome copies, e.g. the British Museum (Garrick), the Bodleian (G.Harvey-Parker- \nBliss), the Huntington (Hoe), and the Huth-Chew copy now owned by the Rosenbach \nCompany have a cancel title which reads: \u2018[in type-ornament border] THE POSIES | \nof George Gafcoigne | Efquire. | Corrected, perfected, and augmented | by the Author. \n1575. | Tam Marti quam Mercurio. | [publishers\u2019 device, McK.n.186] | Printed at Lon- \ndon for Richard Smith, | and are to be folde at the Northweaft | doore of Paules \nChurch. |\u2019. This cancel title is uniform with the title of the Steele Glas and may represent \nan alteration made with that in mind. But if so, it seems to have been rather futile for \nof four sets of these books which we have seen bound together two have the titles which \nare not uniform. \nIn cataloguing the Britwell copies of these two issues the Sotheby cataloguers pointed \n\nVOL.AIL [ 391 J\n\nout that the copy having the device on the title and without Bynneman\u2019s name in the \nimprint also had Sig Gg in uncorrected state, whereas the copy having the other state \ncopy) had the corrected state of that leaf and consequently was the \n\nof the title (present : e \n: there is no connection between the state \n\n\u2018second issue\u2019. However, as is quite reasonable, \u00a2 the \nof the title and that of sheet G, for the alterations in the latter were made while it was \n\npassing through the press and copies were bound regardless of whether they were cor- \nrected or not, as instance the Huth-Chew copy which has the title without Bynneman\u2019s \n\nname and Sig Gq in corrected state. \n\u2018The alterations found in Sig G4 are as follows: (1) Uncorrected state, signed \u2018F4\u2019, and \nwithout catchword; (2)Partially corrected state, correctly signed, but still without \ncatchword (eg. the Griswold-Morgan copy); (3)Corrected state, correctly signed, and \n\nwith catchword (eg. the present copy). \n\u201cHalf a hundred of Gascoignes poesies\u2019 were confiscated from Richard Smith \u2018by \n\nappointment of the Q.M.C\u00e9missioners\u2019 the 13th August 1576 along with other books \nprinted by R.Jones and H.Kirkham (see Greg Records pp.86-7). \nCopies of this edition are quite uncommon, we can locate only a dozen including both \nissues, and several of those are imperfect. The present is without doubt one of the finest \nknown. \n\nS.T.C. 11636. Hoe Car, II (1903) 246. W.A.Watre Car., 50. Huntincrow C.L., 158. \nGrower Cis L-W, 88. Hur Car. II, 583.

Sig's \nwas printed as [[{4], and in the present copy is still in place although the catchword on verso \n[4{4] indicates that it should follow. \n\nTuis is mainly a reprint of the second editionft but in this edition the Steele Glas (sec- \nond edition) and Philomene are included for the first time. The title \u2018The vvhole \nwoorkes\u2019 was evidently considered a misnomer and indeed it is far from accurate. Con- \nsequently, before the type was distributed for that sheet, the second line of the title was \naltered to read \u2018| pleafaunteft workes of George |\u2019 [see next number]. \nWhile this edition was in the press numerous alterations were made, particularly in \nregard to the addition of marginal notes, but as no care appears to have: been taken to \nsegregate the corrected sheets from the uncorrected ones these variations have no \ntemporal significance. In the case of the inner half of quire F (containing the end of the \nSupposes and the beginning of Jocasta), by some accident of the printing-office such as \nthe destruction of some part of the printed sheets or an error in counting of them, two \nentirely distinct settings are known. In one, e.g. the present, the argument, recto [F5], \nends with the motto \u2018Si fortunatus infelix.\u2019, while in the other, e.g. following number, \nit reads \u2018Fortunatus infcelix.\u2019. In the present setting the factotum on recto [F6] is up- \n\nThe books at Cassiobury Park were finally dispursed at Hodgsons\u2019 in three sales in 1922. However, a num- \nber of books had previously been sold. Two MS. catalogues compiled by Dean William Stanley about \n1680 were listed in Thorpe Cat. II (1828) Lot 2941. The quarto catalogue (Heber-Phillipps) is now in the \nGrolier Club. The present volume is there listed on p.[53}. \ntthe list of contents of the #eedes is reprinted from the second edition verbatim although the page ref- \n\u2018erences are no longer pertinent. However, the irregular pagination of that edition and even, in a few cases, \nof the first edition is frequently preserved. \n\n[ 393 ] \n\nVOL.IL\n\neg. following number, it is righted. Neither setting of \n\n. hile in the other, \u2019 \nside-down, while 1 . e title, though that in the present \n\nthis sheet appears to be peculiar to either state of th \n\ncopy is apparently much the rarer. ; \n4 the ee way there appear to be two settings of several sheets of the Steele Glas, \n\nviz. the outer sheet of quire V, the inner sheet of quire X, quire Y, the outer sheet of \nquire A, and the second half-sheet D. The two settings may be easily distinguished \n\nfrom the following table, here printed from notes supplied by Mr.F.S.Ferguson. \nrirst(2) SETTING SECOND(?) SETTING \n\nRecto Va [no marginal notes] {marginal notes] \n\u201cx {no marginal notes] [marginal notes] \n\u201cyy, Lgoends wight, fraight, \n\u201cyg, 11316 [italic \u2019s) [roman {\u00b0s] \n\u201cAr headline of phylomene. of Phylomene. \n\u201cDr signed Dei. U.j. \n\nSo far as we have examined, the second setting of these sheets is the one most com- \nmonly met with but the settings are sometimes mixed (e.g. both copies in this library, \nand the Grenville copy). They very likely represent not corrections but merely that in \nmaking-up copies these sheets, and possibly others, were exhausted and had to be \nreprinted. \n\u2018The Malone 588 copy, which has the appearance of having been made-up and is \notherwise imperfect, has the sheets of the first edition of the Seele Glas [q.v.] with a \ncancel title from the same setting as in the present. Another copy, in \u2018original vellum\u2019, \nin the same condition is said to have been sold at Hodgsons\u2019, 21 July 1921. An allowance \nwas later granted by the auctioneers, presumably on account of imperfections or sup- \nposed imperfections. We have not been able to trace this copy although it would be of \nconsiderable importance to examine it for from it might be ascertained whether Jeffes \noriginally issued the sheets of the first edition of the Steele Glas with this book and \nreprinted them only when the supply was exhausted. \nThe original entry to Smith, if there were one, would have been in that portion of the \nStationers\u2019 Register which has been lost; there is no record of a transfer to Jeffes. How- \never, the title was entered the 6th November 1598 (Atber I1I.131) to W. Wood along \nwith eight other books of which all those now identifiable were at one time also the \nproperty of Smith. It is therefore possible that in the present instance Jeffes was acting \n\neither for Smith or under some temporary arrangement (see Chapman's Banguet of \nSense). \n\nS.T.C. 11638.

William Seres published both those editions and another \nin 1675.

It was under this arrangement, apparently, that the \nsucceeding editions of 1584, 1587, 1593, 1603 and 1612 were issued.

        "text": "THE GOSYNHILL FLYTING \n\nTus literature of the Middle Ages is prolific in warnings against marriage, in tales of \ndomestic discord and in satires upon women. In England most of these are scarcely \nmore than translations from the German and, especially, the French Buranic verse. \nTheir popularity in the early sixteenth century may be attested by the number which \nWynkyn de Worde considered worth his while to print. Later in the century numerous \npieces of the same tradition but only in part based upon the earlier exempla and jest- \nbooks continued to feed the popular interest. Many of these later works were published \nin the form of broadside ballads and hence, the greater part are now known only by their \nentry in the Stationers\u2019 Register. Of the mid-sixteenth century poetical tracts of this \norder The Schole house of women is perhaps the most representative, certainly at the \ntime of publication it aroused the greatest interest being reprinted at least twice and \n\nprobably three times. \nThe edition ($.T.C. 12104) ascribed to Walter Lynne but which, according to Col, Isaac, was apparently \n\nprinted by R.Jugge 1557-8, is not an edition of this book but a quite different tract in the form of \u201cA \ngodly dialogue or communication of two Systers [Justina and Serapia; with an address to the Reader \n\nby WeLynnel.\u2019. \n\nVOL.IL [ 401 ]\n\nDespiteits tile the Scholehouseis merely a diatribe in rhyme-royal against \u2018femynye! \nbut itis distinguished by considerable narrative if not poetic skill though borrowing \nfreely from the Quinze joyes de mariage and the C.Mery Talys, (see outline in C.H.E.L, \nII, 100). The medieval vigour of this denunciation, though to the popular taste, \nbrought forth three refutations; the four books together forming what may be called, \nfor want of better name, the Gosynhill yting. It is no small triumph that copies of all \nfour of these very rare works are here garnered. \nBefore discussing the several books, it should be observed that though lacking in the \npersonal abuse of the usual literary quarrel, possibly because the various contributors \nwere not very well known to each other, it still retains the conventional characteristics \nof the more widely known \u2018disputacyons\u2019. Thus the authors\u2019 comments regarding these \nbooks and themselves may well be merely part of the pleasant fictions of dreams and \ndialogues with which they are filled, but if we are denied such evidence as may be \nderived from these statements we must forego any attempt to elucidate the many \nobscure points of this controversy for there is no evidence except internal. \nThe first edition of the Schole house may have been an undated duodecimo edition \nprinted by Robert Wyer of which no copy is now known. That such an edition was \nactually printed, however, seems assured by the fact that Ames, followed by Herbert, \nDibdin and Hazlitt, described it with particularity. In Ames\u2019s sale catalogue, 1760, \nLot 870, among the \u2018Octavo et infra\u2019, occurs a book entitled \u201cHere begynneth a lytell \nBoke named the Scole howse, wherein every Man may rede a goodly prayse of the \ncondycions of Women.\u2019 which is probably a copy of the edition in question.t It seems \nprobable that this now untraceable edition was issued about 1540, because the edition \nprinted by Thomas Petit in 1541tt contains a reference to Gosynhill\u2019s Prayse of all \nwomen \u2018A fole of late, contryued a boke . . . Pehan he calleth it . . . \u2019 which since \nthe Prayse was written in answer to the Schole house would appear to be an interpolation \nin the second or later editions. However, since \u2018contryued\u2019 does not necessarily mean \n\u2018printed\u2019 it may be that the \u2018boke\u2019 referred to was in manuscript as the third stanza of \nthe Prayse seems to infer, \u2018. . . Sende forth fome other . . . The Pean thou wrote, \nand lyeth the{e] bye . . . '. It is at least possible that both volumes were planned \nand written before the publication of either. \nAbout this same time but presumably after the publication of at least one edition of \nthe Schole house and certainly after sth July 1541 when he was admitted a freeman, \nWilliam Middleton brought out The prayse of all women as a refutation of the Schole \nhouse. In an author\u2019s note at the end Edward Gosynhill declares himself to be responsi- \n\n  \n\nHn Herbert's annotated copy of his Typographical Antiquities, now in the British Museum, he has recorded \n\npe ye dition has a tile page border composed of naked women (je. McKerrow and Ferguson \n0.25). \n\nPetits edition is dated on the title \u20181541\" and in the colophon \u20181561\u00b0 \n\nve ene, \nBe a cert date is doubtless the correct one, The placing of the Petit edition, which is in quarto, \nafter the Wyer edition, which is in duodecimo, contraverts the usual o \n\nis d \nonly by the sie 2 der of such formats and is excuse \n\u2018iy the argument given above, The discovery of the Wyer edition would quickly settle the question. \n\nbut since Petit ceased printing in \n\n  \n\n  \n\n[ 402 ]\n\nble for this work and yet, surprisingly enough, in the second stanza of the text a \nfodeyne affemble\u2019 in a dream accuses the author of having also written the Schole \n\nhouse: \u00ab . a boke, that lately is past \n\nWhyche by reporte, by thele] was fyrst framed \nThe scole of women, none auctour named \nIn prynte it is passed, lewdely compyled \nAll women wherby be sore reuyled.\u201d \nThis, accepted at its face value, would seem to indicate that Gosynhill wrote on both \nsides of this controversey although, if so, he refers to himself, the author of the \u2018Pean\u2019, \nas a \u2018fole\u2019 which, however, need not cause too much concern. A comparison of the two \ntracts reveals a decided similarity of style, both being in rhyme-royal and both show- \ning approximately the same easy command of the doggerel-like verse. As to Gosynhill\u2019s \nidentity, however, nothing seems to be known\u00a7. \nIn 1542 appeared another answer to the Schole house entitled \u2018A dyalogue defensyue \nfor women, agaynst malycyous detractoures\u2019 (q.v.], which from the fact that both the \ndedication and the address to the reader are signed \u2018Robert Vaghane\u2019 has caused this \nwork to be attributed to someone of that name, though variously spelled. The fact \nthat Vaughan disclaims the work as his own has been disregarded as but the conven- \ntional disclaimer of one not a professional writer, however, Miss White (op. cif. II, \n165-9) has pointed out that this book contains several acrostics one of which gives the \nname \u2018Robert Burdet\u2019 twice. As a ballad-writer of that name is known (S.T.C. 4104) \nit is possible that it is he who was the author of this poem. The Dyalogue is between a \nFawcon and a Pye with occasional discursions by the author who narrates the whole. \nThe \u2018argumentacyon\u2019 both for and against the \u2018woman\u2019 is derived chiefly from the Bible \nand from classical authors. \nFor the time being the dispute was allowed to rest but some seventeen years later \nJohn King considered the Schole house [q.v-] of sufficient interest to have it entered in \nthe Stationers\u2019 Register (Arber 1.75). Evidently King\u2019s right to the copy was legiti- \nmately obtained for the title compartment (McKerrow and Ferguson n.37 6) which \nhe used when printing it in 1560 had also previously belonged to Petitfa so that King \napparently acquired at least some of both the furniture and copyrights belonging to \nPetit\u2019s estate. Although it was in 1557-8 that King entered for his copy in the Schole \nhouse the only known edition of that book bearing King\u2019s imprint is dated 1560. How- \never, this does not preclude the possibility that he printed another earlier edition; on \nthe contrary, there is some reason to believe that he had, for, shortly after his entry for \nthe Schole house, King made another entry (Arber 1.79) for a Defense of swomen which \npresumably refers to Edward More's \u2018A lytle and bryefe treatyse called the defense of \n\n\u00a7Miss Beatrice White has suggested (Huntington Bulletin 11, 168) that a certain \u2018Pike\u2019 may have been the \nauthor of the Schole house, The evidence is not wholly convincing. \njaMr.F.S.Ferguson (Quaritch Cat, 369 No.1082) has pointed out that this compartment with the initials \n\u201cTP\u2019 in both tablets and sill was used by Petit in his edition of Longlande\u2019s \u2018Sermone made before the \nKynge . . . at grenewiche . . . 1537\u2019 [21538] (S.T.C. 16796). \n\nVOL.II [ 403 J\n\nwomen\u2019 [q.v.] which King also printed in 1560.42 Now in the dedicatory epistle of that \nwork, dated 20th July 1557, More explains that having come across a copy of the \nSchole house at the book-sellers he was so outraged by its tenor and argument that he \nwas impelled to write this rejoinder. Of course it is possible that the copy which More \nfound was of an earlier edition but in view of the fact that the entry for his book was \nmade just a few months later in the same year as the entry for the Schole house, makes \nit seem more reasonable to suppose that King had published an edition of Gosynhill\u2019s \nbook at the time of his entry for it. The fact that no copy of such an edition is known \nneed not be considered as affecting the argument materially for of the three known \neditions of the Schole house two are represented by unique copies and the third just \nmisses that distinction by one. Nevertheless, as noted above, the character of this \nevidence must be considered. \nAs in the case of Gosynhill and Burdet or Vaughan the identity of the author of this \nreply is obscure. However, the dedication of the book to a secretary of Sir Philip Hoby \ngives some information. In the first place, More says of himself that he was but twenty \nyears old in 1557, and, in the second, that in some fashion or other, probably remote \nconsidering his youth, he was connected with Hoby\u2019s circle which included Sir John \nMason, Sir Richard Moryson, Thomas Paynell and Sir John Cheke, a group which was \nprominent in the introduction of renaissance culture into England (cf. Underhill Span- \nish literature in the England of the Tudors, pp.g0-g). Such a connection would explain \nthe author\u2019s reaction to the Schole house. \nJohn King appears to have interested himself rather heavily in the books of this \ncontroversy for besides the Schole house and More\u2019s Defense he also reprinted Gosyn- \nhill\u2019s Prayse of all womentfa (q.v.]. \nAs to the date of the King edition of the Prayse very little evidence can be adduced \nfor the state of the block used on the title is not conclusive. It is usually dated [15607] \nand there seems no good reason to doubt that it was printed about that time. This much \nmay be deposed, however, that when More wrote his Defense the name of the author \nof the Schole house was unknown to him and, therefore, assuming that if King\u2019s edition \nof the Prayse had been printed he would have seen it and would have learned from it \nthe identity of the author of both works, which is somewhat presuming, the date of \nKing\u2019s edition of the Defense establishes a terminus a quo. This, of course, does not by \n\ntaThough this edition of 1560 is the only one known it might well be suspected of being a reprint for each \npage of the last sheet has 36 lines instead of 35 as in the other two sheets while the colophon is crowded in \nwithout ornament in just such a way as would be natural in compressing a reprint so as to eliminate a \nfinal half-sheet. \nHalt is interesting to note that they were all issued with their titles in the same compartment which King \nused in an edition of the Proude Wyues Pater Noster which he printed in 1560, This fact lends to these \neditions a superficial uniformity which is contradicted by the fact that the paper is different in each and \nthe font of type used in the Prayse differs from that used in the Schole house and the Defense. The state- \nment made in the C:H.E.L. III, 1o1, that King's editions of these two last were issued together in one \nvolume is probably based upon the fact that the British Museum copies occur bound together in a volume \nof tracts [C.20.\u00a2.31(2-3)] which has been described by Dr. Stein Trans. XV (1934) 38-48. \n\n[ 404 ]\n\nany means resolve all the difficulties for there is the possibility, even the probability, \nthat, as noted above, one or more editions of these books, no copies of which are known, \nwere printed.",

XII, 441) that the \nedition of this work said to have been issued in 1587, first mentioned by Haslewood and \nrepeated by Collier, Corser and Hazlitt, is a \u2018ghost\u2019. The belief in such an edition \nappears to be founded upon a misunderstanding for both the external evidence of the \ndate of entry in the Register (23 August 1589) and the obvious design of the work \nitself show that it was intended as a reply to Euphues, his censure to Philautus which \nwas first published in 1587 (entered 18 September). Indeed, the title, especially of the \nfirst two editions, 1589, and 1599, makes that intention quite apparent for it reads \n\u201cMenaphon: Camillas alarum to slumbering Euphues\u2019. The change of title in the third \nedition, 1610, was probably due to the publisher\u2019s desire to emphasize the pastoral ele- \nment on account of the current popularity of that type of literature. \nThe Arcadia is of interest not only as one of the best examples of Greene\u2019s pleasant \ntales and as the source of several of his occasional poems not infrequently to be found \nin the anthologies, e.g. \u2018Weepe not, my wanton, smile vpon my knee\u2019, but also because \nit is connected with the Harvey-Nashe controversy. The address which Nashe prefixed \nto this work provoked Richard Harvey to turn his attack from the Anti-Martinists in \ngeneral to Nashe in particular. Nashe\u2019s letter is also of interest as a review, somewhat \nprejudiced it is true, of the state of English literature at that time. \nIt was from a copy of this edition that Sir Egerton Brydges reprinted this work in \nthe first volume of his Archeica. \nCopies of this fourth edition are not as rare as are most of the books of Greene. How- \never, there seems to be no copy of an edition earlier than the present in private handsf. \nOf this edition there are copies in the British Museum, Bodleian (Crynes and Malone), \nHuntington, Harvard, Folger (Corser-Britwell), and the Vienna State Libraries, as well \nas three others, including the Huth, now in the hands of booksellers. \n\n\u2018The Bindley-Heber-Britwell-White copy of the first edition is in the Folger Library, and the White copy \nof the 1610 edition is at Harvard. \n\nS-T.C.12275.

When catalogued by Wrangham \nin 1826, this copy was apparently bound with several Marprelate tracts. \n\nBecause of the much quoted \u2018Shake-scene\u2019 passage (verso Ej of the present edition), \n\u2018the most celebrated and earliest allusion to the \u201cupstart crow\u201d Shakespeare\u2019, this \npamphlet is well known, by title at least, to many not particularly conversant with the \nsociological literature of Elizabethan times. Not so well known is the fact that, from \nexternal and internal discrepancies, it is possible to make a fairly convincing argument \nagainst the attribution of this work to Greene. J.P.Collier appears to be the first to have \ndoubted Greene\u2019s authorship but he has been followed by others, (see unpublished \ndissertation by Miss Florence Trotter, University of Chicago, 1912, and especially a \npaper by C.E.Sanders P.M.L.4. XLVII,392-417)- \nThe entries for this book in the Stationers\u2019 Register are baffling. The first entry \n(Arber 11.620, 20 September 1592) reads: \u2018William Wrighte Entred for his copie, vnder \nmaster watkins hande vppon the perill of Henrye Chettle\u201d a booke intituledGREENEs \nGroatsworth of wyt Lought with a million of Repentance. . . . vj S[tirrop Warden)\u2019, \nfrom which may be derived independent confirmation of Chettle\u2019s story of his responsi- \nbility in the publication of this work. The second entry (Arber II1.72, 20 October 1596) \nreads: \u2018Thomas Creede Richard Olif Entred for Richard Oliffes Copie GREENEs \ngroates of witt printed by John Danter. And Thomas Creede from tyme to tyme to \nprint this book for Richard Oliff . . . vj4.\u2019. From this it would appear that Danter \nwas the printer of the first editiont, and perhaps also the owner of the rights to it for \n{This motto is inscribed several times after the author's name in the text. \ntlc is an octavo in fours collating [-*(the first a blank), B-F*, which Creede was able to reprint in five and \n\na half sheets by omitting the blank preliminary leaf and compressing the text to the extent of one leaf. \n\nVOL.

In this \nconnection it should be recalled that Danter was at one time in partnership with Chettle \nwho, if he did not write this tract, at least brought it to the press. However, an examina- \ntion of the first edition reveals that Danter printed only the last three sheets; the first \nthree were by John Wolfe. Danter\u2019s equipment was never very extensive and this divi- \nsion may have been made to hasten the publication. \nThis is the last edition to contain the address to the Gentlemen Readers. In the later \neditions appear two pieces (one in verse at the end) signed \u2018IH.\u2019 These have been \nattributed to John Hind or Hynd. \nCopies of all the early editions are extraordinarily scarce. In 1886, Grosart knew of \nno copy of the first edition, 1592, and only the Huth copy of the present. In 1909, how- \never, the British Museum acquired from a provincial bookseller a copy of the 1592 \nedition and since then the Fenn-Frere copy (sold Sotheby's 14 February 1896, Lot 701) \nhas passed through the hands of W.A.White and is now in the Folger Library. Another \ncopy is reported in the Bodleian Union Catalogue as being in the Worcester College \nLibrary. Of the present edition two copies other than the present are now known, both \nin this country; the before-mentioned Jolley-Corser-Huth at the Huntington, and an \nimperfect copy of unknown provenance in the Folger Library. \n\n4H The later history of this copyright may be traced in Arber III.575, 581, and 1V.434. \n\nS.T.C. 12246.

The first part had been \npublished in 1583; only one copy, the Bodleian, can be traced. It is possible that an \nedition of that part even earlier may have been issued for it was entered in the Register, \ngrd October 1580, and in the address to the present part, which was entered 6th Sep- \ntember 1583, Greene deplores the length of time which he has taken to write it. Such a \nstatement would not likely be made if the first part had not been abroad in print for \nsome time. Certain it is, at least, that this second part was written some ten years \nbefore the date of this present printing for besides the evidence of the entry the dedi- \ncation is dated from Clare Hall which Greene must have left not later than 1583 and \nconsequently the present is probably not the first edition that was published. More- \nover, although this is the only extant edition, the book was considered sufficiently \nvaluable for Waterson to pay 6d. the 3rd September 1604 for the transfer of its copy- \n\nright (Arber III.269). \n\u2018The \u2018Anatomie\u2019 which occupies the last four sheets is patterned after Ovid\u2019s De Arte \nbeing a series of letters regarding men as suitors. \n\u2018The copy here described appears to be the only traceable copy not in a public collec- \ntion and of such only six copies can be located, viz. the British Museum (Wright- \nGeorge III), Bodleian (Malone; Tanner), Huntington (Corser-Huth), Harvard (Dal- \nrymple-Phillips-White), and Morgan (Utterson-Griswold-Irwin). However, the Jolley- \nLocker-Jones and the Britwell duplicate (1854, Lot 225, imperfect) copies have not \nbeen traced. \n\nS.T.C. 12270, Arwer II. 428, Hunrinerow C.L, 185. W.A.WaTe Car, 55.

At least, at that time he paid for only one book but when his widow \ntransferred her rights in this title to Edward Allde (29th June 1624, Arber IV.120) she \ndid not distinguish between the parts. It is therefore possible that the 1586 entry \nmay have actually covered both parts as published in 1587. \nUnlike most of Greene\u2019s productions of the 1580's this volume contains discourses \non various aspects of love rather than a series of tales or romances. \nOnly two other copies of this edition can be traced, both in public collections, the \nBodleian (Tanner), and the Huntington (Jersey-Locker-Hoe). The copy usually noted \nas being in the British Museum (bought 1891) has the text, sheets B-F, of the second \nedition. \nSince all three of these books were bought at the Freeling sale by Thorpe who was Miller\u2019s agent, it is \nsomewhat difficult to understand the significance of this note, However, this \u2018and parcel\u2019 contained other \nbooks which did not come from the Freeling library, e.g. the copy of Chapman's Achilles Shield 1598, \nnow in this collection, as well as the copy of Greene's Menaphon 1589, from the Bindley-Heber-Britwell- \n\nWhite collections, now in the Folger Library. \n\u2018There seems to be a plethora of book-sellers whose names begin with \u2018B\u2019 and who flourished in 1839, \n\u20acg.

Two copies\u00a7 of the fifth edition, 1607, can be located; and one, the Dyce, of \nthe sixth, 1611. Of the present seventh, 1616, eight copies are recorded. The edition \ndated \u20181621\u2019 is a ghost as all copies recorded of that date have their imprints cropped \nand belong either to the present or to some other known edition, The eighth is the \n\n\u2018This \u201cMadrigall to wanton Louers\u2019, here signed \u2018Ralph Sidney.\u2019 i, in the eatlier editions, signed \u2018Ralph \nSidley.\u2019.

Most of these, like the present copy, have not been recognized as belonging to this \nedition because the title was set-up larger than the text~674 inches as against 634\u2014and consequently \ncopies have usually had the last line of the imprint cut off. The Tite copy in the British Museum has the \n\u2018op line of the title cut into instead of the imprint. While printing the title, Stansby evidently realized \nthat he was using too large a scale for he tried to rectify it by omitting, after the fourth ine of the present, \n3 Passage, \u2018to roote out the infectious follies, that over-reaching conceits foster in the spring time of their \nyouth\u2019, which appears in the earlier editions, \n\n[ 420 ]\n\nonly undated edition (?date) published by Smethwicke without printer's name. Three \ncopies are knownta. The ninth edition, 1631, is known by only two copiestta. \nIt is not possible to explain why Ling and Busby did not enter this book in the Sta- \ntioners\u2019 Register since in the same year, 1590, that the first edition of this work was \npublished, they entered and published Lodge\u2019s Rosalynde and later, 19th November \n1607, Ling transferred his rights in both the present and the Rosalynde to Smethwicke. \nOne would naturally suppose that every precaution would be taken to protect the \ncopyrights of so popular an author as Greene. \nA full account of this work is given in Haslewood\u2019s Censura Literaria 11,271, as well \nas by Corser. This much, however, may be said, that from a note appended to the first \npart it appears that this book was written and at least intended to be issued before the \nFarewell to Folly which was entered in 1587, though the earliest edition extant is dated \n1591. \nSeven other copies of this edition have been located, viz. the British Museum (Tite; \nWright-George III, both titles mutilated), Bodleian (Douce, title lacking), Capell (title \nmutilated), Harvard (Jolley-Locker-White, title mutilated), Huntington, and the H.B. \nForman (title mutilated) copy now owned by the Rosenbach Company. \n\ntaThe two variously dated British Museum copies (S.T.C. 12256a and 12257) are identical.

(P.43 is numbered 37, \nin roman, Sig A2; To the Gentlemen Readers, 46 is 36, 47 is 41, and 50 is 40). \n\nRed straight-grain morocco, scroll outline design, lavender end-papers, by James Blackf. 676 x \n694 inches, The Freeling (1836, Lot 1260) ~ Britwell (1922, Lot 333)\u2014Clawson (1, 1926, Lot \n529) copy with Freeling and Clawson bookplates. For further provenance see Morando 1584. \n\n\u2018Tuts is the only known early edition of this work#, but although it was published some \nseven years after Greene\u2019s death there does not seem to be much doubt that he was the \nauthor. It was mentioned as being in preparation in the note prefixed to the Perimedes \n1588, and was entered by White as Greene\u2019s, 9th February 1590. It was probably pub- \nlished about the time of entry for in the address, Greene speaks of a twelve month delay \nin the printing; at any rate the anonymous author of Greene's Funeralls lists it among \nother works by Greene in 1594, so there can be little doubt that it was in print thenff. \nIt is customary to regard the translation of Anacreon\u2019s Mesovuxrlots x08 dats, \u2018Cupid \nabroad was lated in the night\u2019, p.45, as the earliest translation of Anacreon in English. \nBut this of course, even if we refer to a lost edition of 1599, is not quite in accord with \nthe facts for Greene included a slightly different version of this same ode in his A/ci \nwhich was licensed in 1588, though the earliest edition known is that of 1617. Earlier \nalso, from the standpoint of printing at least, are the paraphrases of two of Anacreon\u2019s \nodes which appeared, one in the Phoenix Nest 1593 (Bergk Ode 15, see Haselwood \nreprint, 1926, p.g9) and the other appended to Spenser\u2019s Amoretti 1595 (\u2018suggested\u2019 by \nBergk Ode 33). \n\n{This is identical with the bindings of Freeling\u2019s copies of Greene's Arcadia 1616 (now in this collection}; \nGwydonins 1584 (Britwell), and the Corser-Huth-Chew Newer foo late 1631 (both in the Huntington); \nPhilomela 1615 (Corser-McKee-White at Harvard); Groatesworth 1617 (Corser-Sotheby\u2019s 1892-White \nnow at the Rosenbach Company); Farewell fo Follie 1617 (Corser-Kershaw-sold Sotheby's 1888, and twice \nin 1932), and Mamilia 1593 (Jolley-Locker-Jones) whose present location has not been traced. Freeling \nhad a number of other Greenes which had previously been in various libraries and which had come to \nhim in different styles of binding which he did not disturb, Therefore, it seems not at all unlikely that the \nbooks noted above came to him as a lot either unbound or together in one volume and that Black bound \nthem for him. This is substantiated by a manuscript note in Freeling\u2019s interleaved copy of the B.A.P. \n(Hazlitt 1, 190) where, speaking of the Guydonius 1584, he sayst \u2018I have a splendid copy of this Piece, ... \nTt was purchased in a Lot from Baynes, and may have cost about \u00a37.', The \u2018Baynes\u2019 here referred to was \nprobably the dealer of that name though he may have been the John Baynes who was a fellow of Trinity \nand who bequeathed Joseph Ritson the copy of Grove's Historie of Pelops and Hippodamia now in this \ncollection. If so, since he died in 1787, he must have sold these books to Freeling before that time. In any \ncase, the Guydonins is mentioned, over date 28th November 1815, in the fifth part of Fry's Bibliographical \nMemoranda, p.342, as being then in the library of Sir Francis, \nThe copyright of it was transferred by Mistress White to Edward Allde, 22nd June 1624 (Aber IV.120). \nHeThe fact that the text begins on recto Aq stren \n\n   \n\n  \n\n; 2 igthens the suspicion that the present is not the earliest \nedition published. However, the errors in the pagination of the outer forme of sheet G are such as, unless \none is to regard them as accidental, would have occurred only in a reprint of an edition which began on \nrecto C instead of recto B. This might be explained as the result of the addition in the reprint of eight \nPages of new material at some point before the beginning of sheet G, but as there is no evidence one way \nor the other the question appears to be insoluble, \n\n[ 422 ]\n\nGreene\u2019s translation of the Mecovuxtiotc is perhaps the most pleasing rendering of that \nOde in English but it is difficult to judge for besides the attempts of Oldham and \nHughes there are Prior\u2019s \u201cCupid turned Stroller\u2019 and Herrick\u2019s \u2018One silent night of late\u201d \n(Hesperides 1648, p.26) as well as A.W.\u2019s \u2018Of late, what time the bear turned round\u2019 \nwhich are all delightful. \nOnly six other copies can be located, viz. The British Museum (Wright-George III), \nBodleian (Malone), Huntington (Christ Church-Lyte-Corser-Huth), Morgan (Freder- \nickson-Griswold-Irwin), Harvard (White), and Vienna National Library, but at least \none other copy, not yet identified with the above, has passed through the sales-rooms. \n\nS.T.C. 12260.

The \nargument appears to have arisen from notes made by Bowle and Steevens in the copy \nnow in the Huntington Library. As quoted by Haslewood, British Bibliographer IV, \n210, these notes read: \u2018V. Jackson Cat. of 1760, 2395. Greene\u2019s Hist. of fair Bellora.\u2019 \nSteevens added the following notes: \u2018The hand-writing of Mr.Bowle. G.S. I am \nwell convinced that I have seen another edition of this romance, with a less crowded \nand circumstantial title-page, but cannot recollect where I met with it . . . Iam how- \never much mistaken if the name of Greene was not either printed in the title of the other \nedition, or at least written on it in an ancient hand. I hardly suppose the authority of \nMr. Bowle\u2019s quotation from one of old Jackson's catalogues would have been sufficient \nfor me to rely on G.S.\u2019. As to whether Steevens\u2019 recollection was based upon Bowle\u2019s \nnote, no one can now say, but no other mention of such a book can be found. It has \ndespite this fact received wide currency and as recently as the latest edition of Halkett \nand Laing\u2019s Dictionary this book may be found attributed to Greene. \nOne thing appears to be established, and that is that this book is derived from Juan \nde Flores\u2019s Historia de Aurelio, y de Ysabela of which an earlier translation in English \nhad been several times reprinted. This sentimental tale was at one time, under a com- \nplete misapprehension, regarded as the source of The Tempest. More recently Dr. \nPerrot has sought in it a source for Measure for Measure but Dr. Thomas (Shakespeare \nand Spain) has completely disposed of that possibility. \nThis book has been known to be scarce for nearly a century and yet no more than the \nthree copies which were traced by bibliographers in the 1830\u00b0s have come to light. Of \nthese the Douce (imperfect) copy is still at the Bodleian but the Bowle-Steevens- \nBrand-Blandford-Heber-Corser-Huth copy is now in the Huntington Library which \nleaves the present the only copy still in a private collection. \n\nS.T.C. 11094.

Black Letter. \n\nCottation: A-E*; 20 leaves. \n\nVOL.IL [ 427 ]\n\nContewrs: title, recto [A]; verso blank; dedi- Readers, signed \u2018Robert Greene.\u2019, recto A3s \ncation to Hugh Osleyt, in roman, signed \u2018Rod. the list of characters, in roman, the mottos in \nert Greene), recto A2; French Sonnet, in italic, italic, verso Ag-recto Aq; blank, verso Aq; text, \n\u201cThomas Lodge\u2019, verso A2; To the Gentlemen recto B-recto E4; blank, verso E4. \n\nOlive morocco, extra, padded with blanks, by Charles Smith. 634 x 434 inches. The Utterson \n(1852, Lot goo) \u2014Britwell (December 1919, Lot 39) copy with bookplate. \n\nAppareNTLY before the type was entirely distributed it was found that the demand for \nthis book was greater than had been anticipated and another edition was immediately \nmade ready. The outer forme of sheet A and, with slight changes presumably occasioned \nby unlocking, the inner forme of sheet E, are from the same setting in both editions. \nEvidently the first edition was already sold or, at any rate, gathered and folded, before \nthe second edition was ready, for the copies which we have examined do not have \nmixed sheets as would otherwise be the case. The two editions are usually distinguished \nby the signature to the dedication which in the present is in italic and in the other is in \nroman. A comparison of the two reveals numerous typographical variations\u2014ones \nwhich at first glance, however, appear to present conflicting evidence. In the present \nedition, though the characters as listed in the inner forme of sheet A are numbered, the \nsections devoted to them in the text are not with the exception of the last two in sheet \nE. In the other edition both the list of characters and the corresponding sections of the \ntext are numbered, except for the twelfth section, verso E2 (outer forme). The fact that \nin the inner forme of sheet E, the only portion of the text from the same setting in both \neditions, the sections are numbered would seem to indicate that the edition with the \nsections numbered throughout was the earlier. Under this hypothesis it is difficult to \nexplain why the twelfth section should be numbered in the present edition and not in \nthe other but perhaps, as there are some errors corrected in the present setting of that \nouter forme, it was prompted by a manuscript correction in the copy of the first edition \nused by the compositor and forgotten when it was decided to omit the section numbers \nin resetting sheets B-D. \nIn many ways, though not consciously for it precedes that genre by some twenty \nyears, this pamphlet might be described as a character-book written in the manner of \na book of emblems without the impresses. Twelve characters or types, \u20ac.g- Pope, King, \nCleargy, form the \u2018\u201cMasquerado\u2019. Each has its appropriate Latin motto followed by a \n\u2018glossa\u2019 written in a fervently protestant vein which, nevertheless, displays to good \nadvantage Greene\u2019s nervous and powerful command of English prose. \nOf the present edition we have located five other copies, viz. the British Museum \n(Grenville; Old Royal), Huntington (Hoe), Morgan (Griswold), and the Harvard \n(White). But copies of unidentified editions are in the Dyce, Chatsworth, Ashley \n(Christ Church-Lyte-Huth), and the Wrenn Libraries.

But according to Dr. Greg (Trans. VII, 1926, 217-9), \nMalone first noted that Sir Henry Herbert licensed this book 17th October 1632, and \nthat then the manuscript contained the Treatise in question. However, when Seyle \nentered the book in the Stationers\u2019 Register, 1oth November 1632, it was omitted from \nthe contents there recited, As the second series of signatures begins with D, though \n\nVOL. [ 429 ]\n\nfrom the pagination nothing appears to be lacking, Dr. Greg surmised that the decision \nto omit the Treatise was made before the printing of the second series was begun and \nthat the signatures of the second part were accommodated to those of the truncated \nfirst part. No particular reason can be suggested which can account for such a departure \nfrom the usual practice and it is not unlikely to have been merely a compositor\u2019s \nblunder. . \nMr. Geoffrey Bullough (..8. 15 October 1931, p.802) has further shown that in a \nletter to Sir John Coke, 21st November 1632, John Verney states that the book is \n\u2018now printed and ready to be sold\u2019. However, he inclines to the view that Verney\u2019s \nappeal resulted in the delay of publication and that the date on the present cancel title \nmay actually describe the year of issue. | \nThis is a fine copy with many uncut edges, but there are large-paper copies which \nmeasure nearly an inch and a half more both ways. Such copies are printed on fine \npaper with a circular watermark while the ordinary copies have a unicorn watermark \nif any. However, it should be noted that one of the copies in the Bodleian which is \nquite uncut measures 1034 x 634 inches although it appears to be on ordinary paper. \n\n{Ben Jonson\u2019s copy, later Kalbfleisch, is now in the possession of A.8.W.Rosenbach. \n\nS.T.C. 12361.

Moreover, some ten years after the publication of \nthe present the title was transferred, along with eight others, 6th November 1598 \n(Arber IIL.131), to William Wood. Of these nine titles, three cannot be identified. But \nof the six titles traced, with the exception of the present, editions published by Richard \nSmith are known. Therefore, since in the present edition the dedication to Sir Henry \nCompton, signed \u2018R.Smith\u2019, is one which might well have been written by a publisher \n(see excerpt quoted in Collier Bid/. Acc. (Am.ed.) II, 98) it is not improbable that the \n\u201cR.Smith\u2019 of the dedication was Richard Smith the bookseller. Particularly does this \nseem reasonable when it is recalled that Abel Jeffes, the printer of the present, was \nclosely associated with Smith, having apparently obtained from him publishing rights \n\n  \n\ntPresumably the fellow of Trinity who died in 1787s Ritson might well have met him at Cambridge. \nfT must be admitted that by itself this argument is not of great weight although when it can be supported \nby external evidence, as in this case, it may assume some importance. \n\n[ 432 ]\n\nto several bookst{, without any transfer being recorded in the Register. So, piecing \ntogether these two bits of evidence, it appears to be probable that Richard Smith \npublished an edition earlier than the present. Furthermore, it is not unlikely that Smith \n\nentered for this book during the period (July 1571-July 1576) for which the Stationers\u2019 \nrecords are incomplete. \nThe Huntington (Ashridge-Bridgewater) copy is the only other known. \n\nftE.g.

This translation was made from the \nFrench of Ren\u00e9 Berthault de La Gris, first published at Paris, 1531. In 1529, Guevara issued an authentic \nand much longer text of this work at Valladolid under the title \u2018Libro llamado relox de principes\u2019.

It remains the most solid monument of the Italian reason \nin the sixteenth century, the final triumph of . . . [the] Florentine school of philo- \nsophical historians . . . \u2019. Its interest to English readers, despite its monumental size \nand probable pricet, is evident from the fact that it went through three editions in \nforty years. A translation by Sir Robert Dallington of a portion of this history censored \nin the original Italian was published in 1629. \nThis may well have been the book, in its first edition, 1579, upon which Richard \nField first worked when he came to London and was apprenticed to Vautrollier. If so, \nhis purchase of the copyright may have been partly dictated by sentiment for he is not \nlikely to have obtained a bargain from Bonham Norton. \n\ntLess courageous or wealthy readers were able to satisfy themselves with an abridgement published by \nPurfoot in 1591. \n\n8.T.C. 12459.

Robert Dexter, gist March 1 597 \nentered \u2018a booke intituled Virgidemiarum conteyninge Sixe bookes with these titles \nfollowinge viz. Three bookes of totheles Satires, 1 poetical, 2 academicall, 3 morall, \n4 tragedie of Sismond, 5 northern mothers Dlessiingey 6 the waye of thrifte, to be \nprinted at all tymes by Thomas Creede\u2019. These six \u2018bookes\u2019 he published in two parts: \nthe first, containing the \u2018Three bookes of totheles Satires\u2019, with the same title and, \ncollation as the first part of the present except that the imprint read: \u2018London | Printed \nby Thomas Creede, for Robert | Dexter. 1597 |\u2019t; the second, containing the last three \n\u201cbookes\u2019, with the title \u2018Certaine worthye manuscript poems . . . Imprinted at Lon- \ndon for R.D. 1597.\u2019. Presumably, since the title of the first part, 1597, mentions \u2018Sixe \nbookes\u2019, these two parts were then issued together but, curiously enough, no copies so \nissued{ can be traced. \nA year after his first entry, goth March 1598, Dexter entered \u2018A booke called \nVirgidemiarum Three Bookes, or seconde parte of the Satyres Conteyninge Three \nbytinge Satyres.\u2019. Presumably, about that time Hall, having found his work brought to \npress whether he wished it or not, decided to ensure that it was correctly printed so, \nas Dexter states in his note on p.106 of the second part: \u2018After this impression [of the \nByting Satyres] was finished, vpou [sic] the Authors knowledge J had the viewe of a \nmore perfect Copy, wherein were these additions and corrections, . . . \u2019. Apparently, \nthis second edition of the Toothlesse Satyres was not printed until after the Byting \nSatyres was off the press for the title reads \u2018Corrected and amended\u2019 which would \nindicate that the text was either seen in proof by Hall, or set-up from his manuscript \nor from a corrected copy of the 1597 edition furnished by him. \n\u2018Though perhaps too few copies of the present edition can be located to give much \nweight to this conjecture, it is not improbable that Hall induced Dexter to issue these \n1598 editions of his satires without the \u201cCertaine worthye manuscript poems\u2019 which in \nthe 1597, and again (reprinted but with the original date retained) in the 1602 edition \nhad been incongruously issued with them. All copies we have traced, including the \npresent, Lambeth, Morgan (Irwin), Dyce, Huntington (Bridgewater), and Harvard \n(White) of the 1598 editions of both parts are without the \u2018Certaine worthye manu- \nscript poems\u2019. \nHazlitt notes a copy of the Byting Satyres 1598 which has a slightly variant title \nfrom that here described which may, as he says, indicate that a second edition was \npublished this same year. \nIt has frequently been observed that these satires were among those ordered by \nepiscopal authority to be burned at Stationers\u2019 Hall in 1599. While it is true that they \n\n{The Park-Freeling-Chew copy is said to belong to a second edition dated 1597. In it the title and imprint \nread as in the first edition but the collation, A-E\u2019, is identical with that of the 1602 edition. Since the \npresent edition intervenes it seems not unlikely, particularly as no other copy can be traced, that the \ncopy in question is made-up. \nCopies of \u2018Certaine . . . poems\u2019 occur which have been bound with the 1599 edition of the Byting Satyres \nbut whether they were originally so issued cannot be determined. \n\n[ 438 ]\n\nwere listed among the proscribed books at that time (Arber III.677) it has not been \nso frequently noted that four days later, 4th June 1599 (Arber I11.678), \u2018Halls Satires\u2019 \nwere ordered \u2018Staid\u2019, i.e. not burned. Presumably it was the present edition which was \nthus treated, at any rate, it appears to be even rarer than the first though from the \nconfusion of the records it is impossible to compile accurate statistics. \n\nS.T.C. 12717.

The second and third \u2018Tomes\u2019 are bound together. \n\nTue present edition of the first volume is a paginary reprint of earlier editions and \nwas made-up from odd stocks printed off as the supply ran out. Other copies of this \nedition having the same general-title are made-up, in part, of sections printed at other \ntimes. \nThe divisional titles in the first volume are variously dated from 1639 to 1647\u2014every \nyear being represented except 1645. That these are not blind repetitions of dates can be \ndemonstrated by the progressive deterioration of the blocks. For example, the portion \nprinted by Miles Flesher contains titles dated 1639, 1640, 1643, 1644, 1646 and 16475 \non all of which occurs the same device, McK.n.375. Up to 1643 the block exhibits only \ngeneral signs of wear but beginning with 1644 the rapid progress of worms can be easily \ntraced and provide conclusive proof that the dates are those of printing. The subjoined \n\n[ 440 ]\n\ntablet shows the participation of the three printers: Flesher, Hodgkinson and Beale. \nIt is not quite clear how Hodgkinson became involved in the printing of this first \nvolume, but perhaps he obtained by private transfer the third part of the copyrights \nin Hall\u2019s works which had originally belonged to Macham and successively to Johnson, \nFetherstone, Pavier and Bird and which were last registered to Stephens and Meredith. \n\u2018The other two-thirds of Macham\u2019s rights had descended by equally devious routes to \nFlesher who had, likewise, acquired many of the numerous rights which belonged to \nButter. However, the latter appears to have retained some copyrights, see Eyre I, 394. \nBeale was represented because he had acquired from Butter the copyright (8th March \n1624, Arber IV.136) of the 9-11 Books of Contemplations and, apparently, would not \nsell out to Flesher. \n\u2018The copy of the third volume was divided among the three printers whose initials \nappear in the imprint. Hodgkinson printed through quire 3B, Grismond through 42, \nand Huntt completed the volume. \n\n{DATE OF DATE OF \nPRINTING QUIRES PRINTER PRINTING QUIRES PRINTER \n1639-1640 LP.

All are copied strictly or with slight variation from Porro\u2019s platest. \n\u2018These engravings are unsigned, but if Harington\u2019s statement is to be taken literally, they were \nthe work of several engravers. Colvin suspects that Jodocus Hondius was one. In the 1634 \nedition the plates were somewhat altered and retouched, and the title re-engraved in reverse. \n\nFirst EpiTION.

The A.H.Joline\u2014 Mark Robin- \nson (I, 1918, Lot 740) copy with Joline bookplate. \n\nTite engravings in this book appear to have been regarded, not only by Harington but \nalso by the public in general, as of considerable interest for in the spring of 1593 there \nwas controversy concerning a project for an edition in colors as is testified by a court \nrecord of the Stationers\u2019 Company (see Collier Bil. Acc. (Am. edit.) II, 252 n.; Greg \nand Boswell Court Records p.46). Nothing else seems to be known of that proposal but \ntwo copies are extant, both on special though different paper, with the plates hand- \ncolored. One, the Hopetoun-White now at the Rosenbach Company, is printed on \nthick quarto paperff, the type being re-imposed\u00a7 for that purpose; the other, the copy \nin a rich binding of the \u2018Mearne\u2019 type sold at Sotheby\u2019s 11 June 1923 and now in the \nlibrary of the late F.B.Bemis, is on large and thick folio paperfa. \n\n}Most copies of Porro\u2019s edition have the 33rd plate repeated as the 3th, though a few, e.g. the Lindesian \nand the British Museum copies, have had the correct plate inserted. The example from which these \nEnglish copies were made evidently lacked the 3th plate for, though the artist has caught the style and \nform of the Porro engravings, that plate in the present is an independent conception. \n$tOnly one other copy on quarto paper can be traced, the Britwell (1924, Lot 18) copy owned by Philip \nHofer. In it the plates are uncolored. \n\u00a7Imposition in two sizes was uncommon, even re-imposition for large-paper being rarely thought necessary, \nin early English printing. In 1655, Moseley published Shirley's The Gentleman of Venice and Polititian \nand Carlell\u2019s The Passionate Lovers in both octavo and quarto. In the quarto issue of the G. of V. Sig Cis \nsigned \u2018B\" which indicates that the octavo issue preceded the quarto. In the octavo issue of the Polititian \nSig Ca is signed \u2018E2\u2019 which indicates that in that case the quarto preceded the octavo. \nfaSeveral other uncolored copies on large folio paper are known, viz. the Lord Burghley-Ashburnham-Sir \nHenry Hope Edwardes copy in the British Museum which measures 1334 x 834; the Harmsworth, 1234 x \n834; the Britwell, 1234 x 8; and the Bemis, 1234 x 734. The Holford presentation copy to Sir Thomas \nConingsby now at the Rosenbach Company also may be on large-paper although it measures only 1154 x \n8446 inches. \n\n   \n\nVOLT (443 ]\n\n\u2018The British Museum possesses the holograph manuscript of this work which Field \nused when printing this edition. Dr.W.W.Greg has examined it in some detail (Trans. \nTV, 1924, 102), and demonstrated its importance as a means of observing \u2018an Bliza- \n\nbethan compositor at work\u2019. oo . \nWhatever the merits of this translation may be (its discursiveness we are inclined \n\nto rate as one of its most attractive features) it remained for a long period the only \nrendering in English of this poem. The \u201cApologie of Poetrie\u2019 which is prefixed, though \nrather whimsical especially in its defence of two-syllable and even three-syllable rhymes, \nis important; while the passage concerning the engravings stands, according to Colvin, \nas a locus classicus on the early history of engraving in England. \n\n$.7.C.746.

The alteration in the title may be explained by the current vogue of conny- \ncatching tractsfa. It is possible that for the editing of this edition, that is for the anec- \ndotes noted above and the new title, Danter\u2019s former partner, Henry Chettle, was \nresponsible but the alterations are not above the ability of the printer or publisher of that \nday. Whoever the editor was, however, he exercised his art mainly in deleting such por- \ntions as were obviously anachronisms, for example, the dedication to the Countess of \nShrewsbury who died in 1567, and the list of \u201cThe unrulye rablement of rascals\u2019 contain- \ning the names of the practitioners known to Harman in 1566. He also omitted the cuts \nand verses which appear in the last two leaves of the earlier editions possibly because \nthe cuts had not survived or, as in the case of the cut of Nicholas Genninges, had been \nsuperseded. \nThe bibliography of the earlier editions of the Caweat is exceedingly confused. It was \nentered by Gryffyth in 1566-7 (Arber 1.334), and, according to a statement in the first \nextant edition, the \u2018first\u2019 edition had been \u2018half-printed\u2019 on All Saints\u2019 Day (1st Novem- \nber) 1566. No copy of that edition exists. The first extant edition, according to internal \nevidence, was being printed at New Year\u2019s Day 1567, and was completed a week later \nfor the colophon is dated 8th January 1567. Of that edition, the title reads: \u2018A caueat \nfor commen cursetors . . . \u2019. Three copies of it are known, viz. the Bodleian, the \nMorgan (Lort-Steevens-Roxburghe-Heber (IX, Lot 1346)-Fuller Russell-Hoe) copyta, \nand the Perry-Bindley-Inglis-North-Corser-Huth-White copy now at the Rosenbach \nCompany.

There is a copy, presumably of this issue, at Chatsworth \nand, according to the Dent catalogue, others are in the libraries of the Society of \nAntiquaries and of the Duke of Buckingham. The printed catalogues of the Anti- \nquaries\u2019 Library and the Stowe sale catalogue do not include the booktta. \n\nfaln the unpublished Court Book C fol. >, as has been pointed out to me by Dr. Greg, there is an entry, \n4 October 1604, \u2018for thendinge of the controu\u2019sie betwene them [i.e. \u2018M'.

What the controversy was about is hardly a matter \n\neven for conjecture. \ntaTwo of the arches were set up by \u2018Merchant-Strangers\u2019, the Italians and the Dutchmen. \ntaHlowever, this is the sort of book the Duke was most fond of. Its also one which may have been classified \namong the prints and so not catalogued with the printed books of the Society. \n\nHountinerow C.L., 201. Hutu Car. II, 655. Hazurrr, 296. Grenvinie Car.

When bought by Henry Huth from \nJoseph Lilly in 1860, this was bound with a copy of Harvey's New Letter 1593. \n\nTuis volume was written in answer to Nashe\u2019s Strange mews but it also contains a long \nreply, written some four years before, to Lyly\u2019s attack in Pappe with an hatchet {q.v.], \nand therefore, though primarily concerned with Harvey's personal controversy with \nNashe, it has a place in the literature of the Marprelate controversy. \nAs Dr. McKerrow has shown this volume, though chiefly written in the spring of \n1593, was not published until autumn. At that time Harvey was at Saffron Walden \n\nVOL.I [451]\n\nand apparently ignorant of Nashe\u2019s retraction published in the first issue of his Chris's \nTeares{q.v.]. Its not likely, however, that Harvey was unaware of the fact that Wolfe \nwas preparing his book for publication for in the introductory letter dated 16 July 1593, \nHarvey speaks of this work as being nearly printed. \u2014 \nThe peculiar signatures of this volume, and particularly the presence of the two \ntitles, has given rise to the belief that the preliminary matter was separately issued. \nDr. McKerrow, however, has pointed out that the signatures of that part are not those \nof a separate publication and that the Supererogation is called \u2018the present Discourses\u2019 \nin the printer\u2019s advertisement at the end of the preliminaries. Presumably, however, \nboth that portion as well as the appended matter in quires Ff and Gg, which are on \ndifferent paper, was added after the rest of the book had been printed. \nTen other copies can be located and at least two more are recorded. Two are in the \nBritish Museum, five and a fragment are in the Bodleian, the Young-Hoe copy is in \nthe Huntington, the Lefferts-White copy is at Harvard, while the McKee copy is now \nowned by the Rosenbach Company. \n\nS.T.C. 12903.

Many of the marginal notes (to fol.68) were made at a \nlater period than the text to which they refer, and the pages containing them are numbered to \nthat point in an early hand, presumably that of Hawarde, himself. The paper is uniform through- \nout with left-handled pot initialed GG watermark, very similar to Briquet 12735. The first few \nleaves have been injured by damp\u2014top margins are repaired. This is chiefly to be regretted \nbecause the author's signature thereby has been destroyed except for the lower part of the \nflourish, recto fol.1. Otherwise this manuscript is in good condition, only a few of the outer \nmargins having become fragile or slightly torn from use. \n\n  \n\nBivpine: Early nineteenth century half red morocco, marbled boards. Probably this was origi- \n\nnally bound in vellum. In rebinding the quires have in many cases been broken, presumably \nby the removal of blank leaves. Fol.33 is bound upside-down. \n\nProvenance: The early history of this manuscript is unknown. It was sold in the Halliwell- \nPhillipps (1859, Lot 1256) and Alfred Mortison (IV, 1919, Lot 3098) sales. \n\nCoutamiow: Because of the tightness of the binding, \naccurately. It appears to have been gathered mainly \n\nin 4, and 8, and several apparently in 10, 12, and ever \ncannot be ascertained. \n\nit is impossible to collate this manuscript \nin quires of 6, but there are still a number \nn 14, How many blanks have been removed \n\n[454]\n\nContents: blank, r.fol.1-v.fol.4; text, r.fol.s- In Camera stellata, termino Hillary | Elizab. \nv.fol.186; blank, fol.187.

Hawarde was a barrister of the Inner Temple who by reason of his taking the \ntrouble to write-up his rough court notes in this blank-bookt has provided unrivalled \nmaterials for the study of the procedure and judgements of the Star Chamber Court \nduring the period covered by his notes. He has also included a few cases at Sessions \n(mostly those in which he was himself concerned as Counsel), in the Kings Bench, in \nChancery, in the Court of Wards and one in the Exchequer Chamber. The trial of the \nGuy Fawkes traitors before a Special Commission is here reported and there is a rather \nlengthy account of the death of Elizabeth and the accession of James}{. The Lord \nChancellor\u2019s annual Charges to the Judges of Assize and the Justices of the Peace are \nalso included. \n\n+The entry reads in part: \u2018Ico John Hawarde del Inner temple va al Courte al Greenewiche one vn mefsenger \ndel Chamber del roigne nofme.

On the same \npage in a minute hand is a Latin quatrain entitled \u2018Scipionis Epitaphium\u2019. \nBaildon has conjectured that the blank leaves, ff.78-84, were left for the proclamations and speeches \nreferred to in this account.",

This is probably the copy listed in Payne's Catalogue 1789, Lot \n1704. \n\nAut the early editions of this allegorical poem are very rare. It is not unlikely that \nothers were published which have not survived. The first extant edition, c.1509, is \nknown only by the copy in the Pepys collection at Magdalene College Cambridge. Of \nthe second extant, c.1520, only one leaf remains, viz. that procured by Bradshaw (see \nCollected Papers p.349) from F.S.Ellis and now in the Cambridge University Library. \nAt one time it had been pasted with other scraps of \u2018Sun-printed books\u2019 and used as \nthe board in the binding of a small octavo volume. \nOf the present edition only one other copy is known, the Brereton(2)-Heber-Britwell \n(1854, Lot 234)-Corser-Huth in the Huntington Library. \n__ The use of a sequence of alternating quires of six and four (or any other combination) \nis not uncommon in English printing. Wynkyn de Worde, especially, was addicted to \nthis practice\u2014in some forty titles examined nearly half were printed in that way\u2014but \nPynson, Redman and Grafton also used it and as late as 1576 (e.g. Gascoignes Droomme \nof Doomes Day, q.v.) itstill fourished. The reason for this usageis still obscure. It has been \nsuggested (Trans. VIII, 1927, 132) that by interposing thin quires between thicker \nones, the book would be more flexible and easier to bind but since the practice was \nfrequently used on slender quartos of only a few quires this explanation is not alto- \ngether satisfactory. \nTitle-signs are here employed.

Quarto. \nCotzation: A-V4(the last, blank and genuine); 80 leaves. \n\nContents: title, recto [A]; verso blank; Latin caped, verso; A.P. to the Reader, recto A3- \ndedication to the Earl of Essex, in italic, signed verso Aq; text, pp.t-1493 colophon, p.[rsol5 \n\u2018LHAYVVARDE., recto [A]; Faultes es- blank, pp.(151-2]- \n\nOlive morocco, extra. 7 x 534 inches. \n\nAny reference to the usurper Bolingbroke gave Queen Elizabeth great concern and the \npublication of this life, especially since it was dedicated to the Earl of Essex, his counter- \npart, aroused her Tudor rage. She caused both the author and the publisher to be \nexamined and imprisoned and was apparently only dissuaded from hanging the former \nby Bacon\u2019s comment, after reading the book, that the author was not guilty of treason \nbut only of felony since he had stolen the better part from Tacitusf. \nThere are four editions} dated 1599 and purporting to have been printed by John \nWolfe. The fact is, however, that not one of the four was printed 4y Wolfe although \nthere is no reason to doubt that the first was printed for him. These editions are dis- \ntinguished in the Short-Title Catalogue Nos.12995-12997a. Alll four have the same colla- \ntion and all contain the same list of errata though, except in the first, the errors are \nmostly corrected in the texts. \nThe earliest edition (S.T.C. 12995) was printed by Edward Allde for Wolfett. The \npresent edition which has Wolfe\u2019s device on title as in the first edition was printed \neither by John Windet, Wolfe\u2019s successor as printer to the City of London, or by \n\nICf. Trans. XI (1930) 212-24, for a discussion of the documents concerning Hayward\u2019s examination by \nJustice Coke which are preserved among the State Papers. \n4H.R.Plomer examined some seventeen copies and in an interesting paper (Library and S, IIT pp.13-23) he \n\nGave alist of variants which he had found and which he erroneously believed belonged to a single edition. \n\u2018HFor more extended notes, see Trans. KV (1934) 364. \n\n[458 ]\n\nWindet\u2019s successor, William Stansby\u00a7. There are large-paper copies of this editionta. \nAs it is the only one of which large-paper copies are known, it was presumably issued \nwith the connivance of the author who, in the dedication of his Lives of the III Norman \nKings [q.v.], reports that Prince Henry \u2018questioned, whether I had wrote any part of \nour English Historie, other then that which had been published, which at that time he \nhad in his hands; . . . \u2019, It is possible that after the accession of James, the author, \nstill mindful of his examination at the hands of Justice Coke, but desirous of having \ncopies for presentation to those who might assist him in his ambition to become tutor \nto the Prince of Wales and a member of James's projected Chelsea College, induced \nWindet, c.1610, to counterfeit the original edition so that he might pass copies off as \n\u2018one of a few remaining\u2019. Such an explanation is, of course, highly conjectural but it \nis difficult otherwise to account for the phenomenon of a large-paper counterfeit. \nRegarding the third and fourth editions, see next number. \nThe copyright in this title can be traced almost without a break until 1639f\u00a2, and \nyet there is no means of connecting any of the owners of the rights with the three later \neditions. It is equally difficult, except by condemning them as fraudulent, to account \nfor the retention of the false imprint and the evident care that was taken to imitate the \ngenuine Wolfe edition in the second and third. The \u2018deposition scene\u2019 had apparently \nno great terrors for James, and, after Elizabeth\u2019s death, the Earl of Essex might be \nremembered with impunityt{2. However, it is possible that the recollection that the \noriginal edition had been condemned might have enabled the publishers, by counter- \nfeiting the original, to dispose of copies at a higher rate\u00a7@ than was customary for \n\n  \n\nnormal reprints. \nAlthough indicated by the title of the present, no second part was ever issued. A \nmanuscript continuation, however, was sold at Sotheby\u2019s 14 April 1924, Lot 319. \n\n  \n\n\u00a7In this edition all the errors have not been corrected, eg. that on p.7t, and one each on pp.86 and 127, \nThe device on the title was used by Windet as early as 1606 in Marston's Wonder of Women, Greville\u2019s \nMustapha 1609, and elsewhere, The ornaments and initials are all close copies of those used by Allde in \nthe first edition: e.g. the factotum, recto A2, occurs in Daniel Tethys Festival, Windet, 1610 [q.v.|; the \nApostle A, recto A3, in Johnson Seven Champions Pr. IT, Stansby, 1626 [q.v.]; the floriated T, recto As, \nin Cortes rt of Navigation, Stansby, 1615, etc. \nfaViz, British Museum (Grenville), Lambeth (Archbishop Abbot), and Harmsworth (Vincent-Scott-Heber- \nBritwell). Of these the Grenville, which measures 934 x 7 inches, is the tallest. \nfeArber 11.134, 232, 420-1 and 621; 1V.153 and 459. \nttaCf, notes under Shakespeare Richard IL 161s, and Hakluyt Voyages 1598. \n\u00a7aFor proof that such was the practice, see Marston's Pigmalion 1598. \n\nS.T.C.12996.

Two of the blocks \nwhich were used in the first edition, printed by Edward Allde, viz. the headpiece and \nApostle A, recto A3, were used by Elizabeth in this edition. The floriated T, recto B, \nsimilar to the one used by Allde, may be traced in frequent use in both Creede\u2019s and \nAlsop\u2019s books; from the present state of deterioration it is apparent that this edition \nwas printed after that initial was used by Alsop in Phaer\u2019s Aeneid 1620}. The tailpiece \nat the end, the only ornament which is not similar to those used in the earlier editions, \nis a block used frequently by both Creede and Alsop. \nThe fourth edition was printed by one of the printers at the shop in Cow Lane \n(W.White, J.

However, before their stints were com- \npleted it was realized that the copy could not be contained in the 92 leaves of their \noriginal computation. The compositor of the last section was not inconvenienced for \nhe could continue indefinitely with both signatures and pagination but the compositors \nof the first two parts had to provide larger quires at the end in order to synchronize \ntheir sections with their alphabets. It will be observed that, although they made an \nerror as to the amount of letterpress their sections would occupy, their division of the \ncopy was fairly accurate for each section now occupies 110 leaves counting blanks. \nFrom the ornaments it would appear that the first section was printed by Griffin; the \nsecond cannot be identified since there are no ornaments; the third, including the index, \nwas printed by Ruth Raworth or her husband Thomas Newcombe. \nAccording to Dibdin (Library Companion 1825, p.526) Lord Spencer possessed a \nJarge-paper copy of the \u2018first folio\u2019 edition of this book. Presumably he meant the edi- \ntion of 1672 for no copy of the present is listed in the Rylands Catalogue though there \nis one of 1672. The Bindley large-paper copy of that edition (IV, 1820, Lot 847) was \nmee by Triphook, the dealer from whom Dibdin said Lord Spencer acquired the \nook. \nAccording to Sir Sidney Lee, the third Earl of Cherbury sued Whitaker in the House \nof Lords regarding this book. Whatever the outcome of the litigation may have been, \nthis title was not transferred after Whitaker's death along with his other copyrights. \n\ntA British Museum copy has before Sig \nwith the frontispiece, That leaf con \nEighth\u2019 signed \u20187[ames}.

(Both states reproduced, \nGrolier Club W-P M1, p.78.) Since the undated state reads more nearly as does the title \nof the second edition [q..], as was first pointed out by L.S.Livingston in the Bidliophile \n(N.Y.Evening Post, 29th June 1907), it is possible that it is the later state. However, \nit is equally possible that the variants have no particular temporal relation and that \nthe undated state (with Green\u2019s name) occurs in that portion of the edition intended \nfor sale at Cambridge and that the dated state was for distribution through the trade \ngenerally. \n_ Because the Huth-Clark and the Hoe-Huntington copies of the undated state are \nin fine morocco bindings of the period it has been suggested that that state was pre- \npared for presentation. The addition in that state of the identifying clause concerning \nthe author and the name of the bookseller from whom copies might be bought would \nseem to indicate that, if the above mentioned copies were actually presentation ones, \nthe fact that they are of the rarer issue was purely accidental. \nWhen \u201cbrother Ferrar\u2019 sought a licence for this \u2018little book\u2019 the Vice Chancellor \nobjected to two lines, now well known, in the \u2018Church Militant\u2019: \nReligion stands on tiptoe in our land, \nReady to pass to the American strand. \n\nEg, the Bodleian, the Baynes-Brand-Heber-Daniel-Lewi \ni -Brand-Heber- Daniel-Lewis-Foote-Hoe-Huntington, idgewater-Hunt- \nington, and the Huth-C.W.Clark copies. eter eae \n\n{ 468 ]\n\nFinally he passed them, saying: \u2018I knew Mr. Herbert well, and know that he was a \ndivine poet; but I hope the world will not take him to be an inspired prophet, and \ntherefore I license the whole book.\u2019. \nThe title \u2018The Temple\u2019 was supplied by Ferrar. \n\nS.T.C, 13183.

The division of the book between \n\u2018two compositors, at the end of sheet Q, as indicated by the signatures of the fourth leaf of each sheet \n(except Sig W and Aa), as well as the general neatness of the typography, make it appear unlikely that \nCopland was the printer for at that time he was too poor to have had two presses and besides was always \na careless workman, However, the title-compartment was his, and initials which he was using both before \nand after this book appeared occur recto B, recto B2, verso Ny, and recto Aag. But the initials on recto \n\u201882 and recto Bb appear in books printed at this time by Tottel. The initials on recto B3 and recto Fa, at \n\u2018one time Berthelet's, and that on recto Dd, at one time Caly\u2019s, though they are not in any of Tottel\u2019s \nbooks which we have examined, may have come to Tottel along with other material which can be traced \nto his shop from those sources. The initial on recto W3, formerly Day's, was used by Wayland shortly \nbefore this book appeared but it also may have passed along with other recorded stock to Tottel as W: \nand apparently retired about this time from active printing. Several of the other initials are very similar \nto ones which are known to have been used by Tottel and as, in a number of other instances, he had more \n\n= one cag of the same design these may likewise have been his though we cannot trace them in \nis work, \n\n  \n\ngate \u00ab= e ts is one of which several printers, including Copland and Tottel, had supplies. \nWee a the period of this book a more worn and dirty look than in this volume. \ncontac tutes aa oe we have seen of Copland\u2019s books, there is a much larger number of \nedition of King tthe which foe at ths book In 1557, Copland finally brought forth his \nsome ne Ae iter which from various typographical indications, had apparently occupied him for \nA general comparison of Tortel\u2019s work with the present volume leads one to believe that it was \n\nneat iar % have been produced in his shop than in Copland\u2019s but, in any case, no satisfactory explana \nwe diversity of sources of the blocks used can at present be found. \n\n[470 ]\n\nblank, recto [N4]; The Argumente of the \nfourthe Booke, verso; text, recto fol.46-85, 85- \nverso fol.[87]; The Argumente of the eyghte \nBooke, recto Aa4; verso blank; text, recto fol. \n\nThe Annotations in forme of a Table, recto \nDdz-recto [Hha]; colophon, recto [Hha]; er- \nrata, verso.

In order to conceal the age and original \npublication of this tract the title as well as the signatures of the commendatory verses \nwere changed. A passage concerning Alleyn was inserted by Cartwright, p.29. \n\u2018The date of publication of this edition, which was brought forth doubtless by the \nagitation regarding the re-opening of the play-houses, can be established with some \ncertainty as during the first half of 1658 by reason of the fact that the Thomason copy \nin the British Museum is dated rsth June 1658. \n\u2018The \u2018W.C.\u2019 of the imprint and dedication was William Cartwright, the actor, for in \nthe dedication he speaks of the profession of the stage as being a common \u2018Quality\u2019 of \nboth Heywood and himself. From the imprint, it would seem that Cartwright caused \nthis edition to be privately printed. He is not otherwise known as a publisher. \n\nHaart I, 487. Cuark Proc. Oxom. Bibl.

Since the text begins on \nrecto A3, this edition has not the superficial appearance of a first, but that perhaps is \ndue to the circumstance that the manuscript, with preliminary matter complete, was \nprepared by Heywood before printing was begun. Consequently the printer could start \ncomposition with the first sheet and permit the text to begin before the second. It is \ntrue that this format is characteristic of all the unauthorized editions of Heywood\u2019s \nplays which, however, either had no preliminary matter except their titles, or, if decked \nout with prologue and dramatis personae, there was, under the circumstances, no possi- \nbility of the author's appearing at the press at the last minute with addresses or \nencomnia which he might insist should be included in the preliminaries. \nOf this edition only five other copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum (McKee- \nW.A.White, imperfect), Bodleian (Malone), Huntington (Inglis-Heber-Devonshire), \nHarvard (Nassau-Fuller Russell-Locker-White), and the Folger (Bridgewater-Hunt- \nington). \n\nS.T.C. 13360.

However, there seems to be very little of it which, according to present views of \noriginality, can be laid to Caxton\u2019s credit (see Brie Geschichte und Quellen der mittelen- \nglischen Prosachronik The Brute of England, Marburg (1905) p.122). \nCaxton appears to have used for the period 1358-1377 the sources which he names in \nhis preface, viz. the Fasciculus Temporum and Aureus de Universo (this latter is uniden- \ntified but in part at least it must have been heavily indebted to Walsingham\u2019s Historia \nAnglicana). For the period 1378-1419 Caxton mainly abbreviated from the Brut chroni- \ncle, though some passages relating to religious matters he took from the Fasciculus, \nand some from an unknown source. From 1419 on, the text is taken almost verbally \nfrom Caxton\u2019s own edition of the Chronicles of England 1480. This last is very litele \nmore than an edited edition of the Brut chronicle (cf. E.E..8. 1 36, 1908, pp.491-533)- \nAccording to the C.H.E.L., the Polychronicon \u2018may reasonably be considered [one of] \nthe cornerstones of English prose\u2019. It is apparently the commonest of all Caxton\u2019s pro- \nductions; with the aid of de Ricci\u2019s Censust forty-six copies can be traced of which \nonly nine are complete. Duff says that no copy is perfect. Several other copies have \nin recent years passed through the auction rooms and it is not unlikely that there are \nin existence nearer sixty than fifty copies more or less complete. \n\nth flonng \u2018ddenda are pertinent: de Ricci No.3=8; 4=76= Huntington; 8= New York Public Library \nan Ros ach Companys 22= Harmsworth; 27= H.L.Goodhare (Roderick Terry); 35 = Rosenbach Com- \nDavey ae nile (WL-Andtews); 7omTowneley copy; 71=Botfeld descendants at Norton neat \nrey fom ei Pe 83=86= Rosenbach Company; and 92= Morgan. \nernon-Holford, perfect except for 2 blanks= 5 ui \nsete lint, pete niks= Rosenbach Company; an unrecorded copy was so \n\nS.T.C. 13438.

That lay-out was apparently \nnot thought sufficiently bold so the present one was substituted (cf. Davies Devices \np.702). In this the top panel is discarded and the next section separated from the lower \nportion so that the compartment, counting the crown at the top, is in three parts. A \nsection was removed at the bottom in which was inserted John Reynes\u2019s mark, McK. \nn.s5, the arms of London were cut for rubrication, and Treveris\u2019s millrind was removed \nfrom the shields at either side of the bottom section.

When sold in the Ashburnham sale two leaves were lacking \nwhich have been supplied. The sheet signed () which in the present is logically bound at the end \nof the first volume generally occurs at the end of the second. \n\nTuus edition was published by George Bishop, John Harrison, Lucas Harrison and \nJohn Hunne. Copies occur with each name alone in the imprint. As many copies have \nbeen made-up by later owners who combined parts having different imprints it is \nimpossible to determine whether the publishers shared equally in the edition. \nReginald Wolfe originally conceived the notion of publishing a \u2018vniuersall Cosmo- \ngraphie\u2019 and in the prosecution of his scheme he spent \u2018xxv yeares trauell . . . therein \n...\u2019 gathering printed and manuscript materials and mapst. He died before the \nprinting had begun and his widow, who died soon after, in her will (Plomer ills pp.t9- \n23) charged her heirs with the prosecution of the task and the protection of Holinshed\u2019s \nrights in it. The publication consequently remained rather a family affair for John \nHunne, haberdasher, was a son-in-law of Wolfe and executor of his mother-in-law\u2019 s \nwill, He is not known otherwise as a publisher. John Harrison, the elder, was also a son- \nin-law, by his first wife (op. cit. pp.19-22); and, though proof cannot be found, Lucas \nHarrison was probably his brother. George Bishop was in partnership with Lucas \nHarrison and, with one of the Harrisons, entered this book in the Stationers\u2019 Register, \n1st July 1578. \nWhen printing was finally begun it was found \u2018that the Chronicles of Englande grew \nso large, as they whiche were to bestow the coste aboute the Impression were not only \ndriven to stay the Impression of the Histories of other countreys, till God might \ngraunt better abilitie and meane to publish the same, but also to deuide the Chronicles \nof these three regions into two volumestt. And because that the one parte of the \nChronicles of England before the Conquest, and the entire Chronicles of Scotland, and \nIreland, with their descriptions, would make but a like volume, vnto the continuance \nof the English Chronicles after the conquest, it hath bene thought good thus to deuide \n\n  \n\nthem as yee may see . . \u00ab \nAs originally printed\u00a7 Sig [E6-8] of the last alphabet of Volume I, pp.75-80, covered \n\nt'The Chartes where in Maister VVolfe spent a greate parte of his time, were not founde so complete as wee \nwished... * and because of \u2018Sackefordes\u2019, ic. Saxton\u2019s, projected atlas it was decided to omit all maps \nfrom the book, \nHThe entire history of England was, as indicated by the signatures, first set-up as one volume. Holinshed \nstates that he inserted in the latter part of the history of Scotland \u2018some notes, as concerned matters of \nwarre betwixte vs and the Scottes, because I gotte them not till that parte of the English Historie vvas \npaste the presse.\u2019, \n\u00a7Several copies having the original setting are known, viz. the Grenville, Capell and Clawson. \n\n  \n\nVoL. [ 497 ]\n\nthe history which in the revised and expanded version (eg., \nthe present) is contained in the cancellans Sig F1-(7], pp-75-9!- The additions which \nver introduced occur at the beginning of Book IIT verso Fi-verso Fa, pp.76-8; where, \nbesides the nine-line heading, which js not in the first state, there is also, following it on \nverso Fi, p76, an address by Stanyhurst to Sidney, which fills page 76 and half the \nfirst column of the next page. It is followed by a paragraph which is in the original \nsetting and, then, the rest of the page (77) and half the first column of the next page \n(78) describing a brawl! between Kildare and Ormond and the death of one \u2018Blanch- \nfielde\u2019, is new. This passage is not in the text published by Sir James Ware in The \nhistoric of Ireland 1633 [9.v-]- The two states may, of course, be easily distinguished by \nthe presence or absence of Sig [E6.8] and the substitution of quire F. \nWhen the latter had been printed off and the printing of the rest of the book was \nproceeding, it was discovered that some of the remarks and anecdotes on recto [F7], \n.go, were in need of editing. That leaf was therefore cancelled and the offending \npassages omitted in a reprint. The cancellans, since nothing was substituted to take the \nplace of the omissions, has four lines of print less than the cancellandum which has \n58 lines to the column. The two may be further distinguished by the fact that the second \nand third lines of the first column of the cancellans on p.go reads: \u2018| throw, as in thofe \ndayes it was commonly bru- | ted. |\u2019. The cancellandum ends the paragraph with the \nword \u2018throw.\u2019. \nThis first edition is usually, following the Huth Catalogue, called \u201cThe Shakespeare \nEdition\u2019, but both W.G.Boswell-Stone and H.R.D.Anders have shown that it was the \nsecond edition which Shakespeare employed as the source, sole or part, of ten of his \nplays. Nevertheless, this first edition is of great importance not only because the \nillustrations were omitted in the second but also because of the variant texts. It is, \nmoreover, in as fine state as the present, the rarer book. \n\nthe same space of time in \n\nS.T.C. 13568b. ArzeR II. 329. Huntinoton C.L.,219. BARTLETT Mr.V.S. No.222. Huta \n\nCar.

This is explained in the Advertisement at the end: \u2018I Haue for some \ncauses (gentle Reader) thought it at this time more fit to let goe these first foure \n\nbookes by themselues, then to stay both them and the rest, till the whole might together \nbe published . . . \"f. \n\n\u2018Concerning the publication of the later books, see editions listed below. \n\n[ 502 ]\n\nWindet obtained an entry for all eight books, 29th January 1593, and presumably \nabout that time began printing such of the copy as was then ready, viz. these first four \nbooks. The work was then laid aside but one may read between the lines of the Adver- \ntisement quoted above and imagine the impatience of the bookseller and the quiet \nfirmness of the author. Under the circumstances, Walton\u2019s statement that this edition \nwas published in 1594 is perhaps not far wrong. \nOne of the present copies, the Wolley, is on thick-paper with a crowned ER water- \nmark which is distinctly finer than the paper of mixed watermarks found in the other, \nthe Hagen, copy. This is of considerable interest because few works later recognized as \nintrinsically important were also originally so considered and issued in special format. \nThe Ecclesiastical Polity is \u2018remarkable as being one of the few theological or philo- \nsophical works which have taken a high place in the literature of the language in which \nthey were written\u2019 (cf.

The printed tables of the Polity have been paged in Viscount Brackley\u2019s \nbold hand and tables for the sixth and eighth books have been supplied by him. \n\nIn this edition the seventh book was first printed but apparently it was not included \nin the original copy. In fact, the publisher's intention appears to have been merely to \nreprint the preceding edition\u2014 Bishop Gauden did not become connected with the \nenterprise until the book was almost ready for publication. The evidence for these con- \ntentions is to be found in the volume as it now stands. Presumably, the eighth book \nbegan on verso [Zz4]. That leaf had to be cancelled when the seventh book was intro- \nduced and a substitute provided. The signatures used in the seventh book are in them- \nselves evidence of late insertion. The eighth book originally ended on verso [Dddg], the \ntext then being the same as that first printed in 1648 [q.v.], but presumably at the time \nthe seventh book was inserted it was decided to add some eight or nine pages of new \nmatter to the eighth book. This was effected by cancelling Sig [Dddg], reprinting its \ncontents on Sig Eeet and continuing the new matter in the inserted sheets Eee*, Ff? \n(beginning verso Eee, pp.216-224). \nNo mention is made in the editorial matter of the additions to the eighth book but \nGauden says of the seventh book: \u2018 . . . by comparing the writing of it with other \nindisputable Papers, or known Manuscripts of Mr. Hookers is undoubtedly his own \nhand throughout\u2019. He does, however, infer that the eighth book was set up from manu- \nscript throughout for he says: \u2018The Eight is written by another hand (as a Copy) but \ninterlined in many places by Mr. Hooker's own characters, as owned by him.\u2019.",

In purple morocco box-case, by \nStikeman. The Britwell (1919, Lot 56) copy. \nIt is possible that this is the copy said to have belonged to Sir Watkins Williams Wynne. There \nare notes in an early, apparently sixteenth century hand, regarding the source of some of the \npieces and also the names of the tunes to which they may be sung. Dr. Nott, in a footnote to his \n1815 edition of the Works of Surrey and Wyatt (p.cviii), remarked that \u2018On the margins of an \nearly copy of his Poems [i.e. the Songes and Sonettes| belonging to Sir W.W.Wynne are preserved \nin the characters of the times, several airs for the lute, to which Surrey's favorite little odes were \nsung. It seems highly probable that these airs were of Surrey\u2019s composition. They are remarkable \nfor expression, for artless sweetness and wild simplicity, and are all marked with a peculiar \ncharacter of plaintive melody. They will be found printed from the original MS. in the late \nedition of Tottel\u2019s Songes and Sonettes, 4t0. 1814 [the edition of which only fragments survive].\u2019. \nWhether, when Nott wrote that passage he was acquainted with Wynne\u2019s copy other than by \nreport, or whether he referred in the latter part of his note to such of the airs which are noted in \nthis copy by name and are elsewhere preserved must remain a matter for conjecture. Neverthe- \nless the fact that Wynne is said by Richard Heber to have had a copy of a 1557 edition and the \npresent is the only copy known with annotations approaching Nott\u2019s description, makes it seem \nthat this is the otherwise lost and confusedly described Wynne copy. \nIn any case, this copy came into the Britwell library after 1870, for it is not included in the \n\nVOL. [srr]\n\nrivately printed catalogue of English poetry in that collection which was printed about that \npn, Moreover, it was apparently bound before acquired because it does not bear the Miller \n\nmonogram, etc. \n\n\u2018Tanne are two editions of this date, both exceedingly rare. Professor Rollins has \ndemonstrated that, whatever their order may be, one must have been printed from \nthe other and not both simultaneously from a common original. He has come to the \nconclusion, although the proof is not very convincing, that the edition of which this \ncopy is an example is the latert. Both editions have the same collation but they may \nbe distinguished by the presence or absence of the {| sign in the first line of the title, as \nwell as by the numerous variant readings recorded by Rollins. \nThere are thirty poems by Nicholas Grimald included in the first edition which \nwere omitted in the second and subsequent editions; and thirty-nine other poems which \nare in the second and later editions but were not in the first. \n\u2018The present volume together with the copies of the three other editions in this library, \nsee Plate No.XVI, form a series which in number can be paralleled or exceeded by those \nin the British Museum and Huntington, but which in condition can be equalled by \nnone. \nOf the first edition (June 1557) one copy is known, the Tanner in the Bodleian. Of \nthe other July 1557 edition there are only two copies, the Grenville (Heber IV, Lot \n2561), and the Huntington (Malone bequest to Bindley-Heber-Singer-Tite-Locker- \nWhite, an unhappy copy with several leaves inserted from another edition). Of the \npresent only two other copies are known, the Capell (?Rawlinson) and the Bishop \nThomas Percy-Lord Caledon copy now owned by the Rosenbach Company. This last \nmay have a much more ancient and interesting pedigree. \n\nIt was his copy of this book that Master Slender lamented he \u2018had rather than forty \nshillings\u2019. \n\n{Whatever the order of these editions may be, the repetition of the date in the colophon may have been due \nto carelessness (cf, Erasmus Praise of Folie 1549). It is also possible, however, that one of these July \neditions was pirated the absence of ornaments and initials make proof unlikely \u2014and, if so, that pirated \n\nedition does not necessarily belong in strict chronological series for it may have been printed after one or \nboth the 1559 editions or even later. \n\nRegarding the possibility that Grimald edited the July editions, see H.J.Byrom M.L.R.

Sold at anonymous sale, Sotheby's 27 April 1858, Lot 596. The \nBritwell (1922, Lot 687) copy. \n\nTue date of this book may be determined by the following. First, the dedicatee came \ninto the title by which he is addressed the 25th August 1554. Second, the type used \nby Day in the dedication is otherwise known to have been used by him, according to \nColonel Isaac, only in two books both printed in 1553-4. Third, Day was committed \nto the Tower the 16th October 1554, and is not known to have printed again in Marian \ntimes. Furthermore, this volume was printed during the few weeks noted above, or \nOwen must have been a very ignorant bookseller, for in his dedication he indicates that \nhe believed he was not only publishing this translation for the first time but that it was \nSurrey\u2019s first production to be printed}. \nThis present unique volume, if we may consider this date established, contains the \nearliest printed English blank verse now known. It also, as Professor Hartman has ably \ndemonstrated in the introduction to the facsimile edition edited by him and privately \nprinted for Mr. Pforzheimer in 1933, contains: \u2018the most nearly authentic\u2019 text of \nSurrey\u2019s translation which has been preserved. It may therefore be looked upon as the \nvery germ or cornerstone of English Renaissance poetry and few volumes in the whole \n\nTwo are conventional border pieces traceable in Day's books; while three are copied by \u2018IC\u2019 (query Jean \nCroissant) from a series of Creation cuts used in Horae printed by Pigouchet, Morand and possibly others, \nsee Claudin Histoire 1, pp.at and 24, The English copies by IC cannot be traced in any other of Day's \nproductions but they were used by Thomas Harper as late as 1641, However the artist who signed his \nwork \u2018IC\u2019 (sometimes with graver between or the \u2018I\u2019 within the \u2018C\u2019) engraved the first series of borders, \n\nthe scenes from the life of Christ, in John Day's Christian Prayers 156g, as well as cuts in Day's edition \nof Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse 1559. \n\n  \n\nMax Rooses (Chr. Plantin 1882, p.26s) attributes the work usually assigned to Croissant to either \nGerard Jansen de Kampen or to Corneille Muller. \n\nTotes text of this translation was published 21st June 1557 (Certain Bokes II and IV) and the first edition \nof the Songes and Sonettes was published sth June of the same year. \n\n[516]\n\n\n\n\n\nrecord of English literature so completely combine intrinsic primacy with physical \nuniqueness. Except for the descriptions made by the Sotheby cataloguers, apparently no \nbibliographer hitherto has had an opportunity of describing this book with the volume \nbefore him. \n\nAes (Edit.

Almost forty of her manuscripts are known of which at \nleast eight are in America, the rest being mainly in England. \nIt is interesting to observe that to this artist form was of more significance than con- \ntent for she has not hesitated to change the wording of the proverbs, nor even to break- \noff in the middle of a sentence. \nThough less elaborate than most of the work of Mistress Inglis this little manuscript \nis not without the characteristic charm of her hand.

The Mostyn (1919, Lot 174) COPY: \n\n[ 526 ]\n\nFrom the fact that this play was entered to Henry Sutton, 1557-8 (Arber I.77), and \nalso because it is \u2018newely imprinted\u2019 according to the title, it may have been previously \npublished though no copy is extant}. This is particularly interesting in view of the fact \nthat if printed about the time of Sutton\u2019s entry, provided the text was as in the present, \nit would be the earliest \u2018regular English comedy\u2019 with act and scene-divisions to have \nbeen printed for Ralph Roister Doister was not entered until 1566-7 (the only extant \ncopy lacks the title and is not otherwise dateable) and Gammer Gurton's Nedle (q.v.] \nwas not entered until 1562-3 (apparently not printed before 1575). \nThis biblical drama has been attributed by Mrs.C.C.Stopes (Bang Materialien, \nXXIX) to William Hunnis with some probability but no direct evidence, and by Bang \nto Nicholas Udall. But authorship aside, the play itself exhibits a growing conscious- \nness of the possibilities of drama beyond the merely didactic and a knowledge of stage- \ncraft unusual at the timef. The direction on the title that the players \u2018are to be con- \nsydered to be Hebrews and so should be apparailed with attire\u2019 is a very early attempt \nat realism. \nSeven other copies are known, viz. the British Museum (Fletewode?-Garrick), \nBodleian (Douce), Huntington (Bridgewater; Kemble-Devonshire), Elizabethan Club \n(Irish Find), Folger, and the Clawson now in the private library of Dr. Rosenbach. \nA leaf is in the Bagford collection. \n\n{Bynneman\u2019s first address, the sign of the Black Boy in Paternoster Lane, was formerly Henry Sutton\u2019s. \nPresumably, therefore, Bynneman obtained his rights directly from Sutton, \ntlt has been noted, English Studies December 1933, that this text contains quotations from Calvin's Insti- \ntutio and therefore must have been written after 1539. \n\nS.T.C. 14327.

The first \nedition is the undated one printed by A.Veale which was issued before the death of \nKing Edward V1 in 1553 for the prayer at the end refers to the king and his council. \nThe only known copy of that edition is the Lincoln Nose Gay-Heber (II, Lot 6430) in \nthe Bodleian Library. Because of its strong protestant bias this play was probably not \nreprinted during Mary\u2019s reign\u2014 Veale\u2019s edition may even have been suppressed. After \nElizabeth\u2019s accession the copyright passed to John King who entered for his copy, 14th \nAugust 1560, However, since King died either later in the same year or early in the \nnext, he probably did not publish it, at least, no copy of an edition bearing his name \nis known. \nThe next extant edition, also undated, was published by John Awdeley probably \nsoon after King\u2019s death, although there is no record of the transfer of the copyright. \nOf that edition there appear to be only two copies, the British Museum (Irish Find) \nand Huntington (Mostyn). The prayer to the king and his council in the Veale edition \n(reproduced in Tudor Facsimile Texts) has been altered (as also in the Copland edition) \nto one for the queen and her council by substituting \u2018quene\u2019 for \u2018king\u2019, \u2018seruaunt\u2019 for \n\u2018calptayne]\u2019, and feminine for masculine pronouns. Awdeley\u2019s edition is apparently \nearlier than Copland\u2019s since it collates A-F2 in fours and therefore, other things being \nequal, the Copland edition is a contracted reprint. A comparison of sorts by means of \nthe Hawkins reprint and the Farmer facsimile reveals nothing which would not con- \nfirm the order of issue here conjectured. In any case, Copland did not print at the \nLothbury address until 1562 which therefore fixes the date anteguem; and as he ceased \nprinting 1568-9 the present edition must have been issued sometime during that period. \nOf the present edition there are only two other copies, viz. the Rhodes-Heber- \nDevonshire-Huntington and the imperfect Garrick copy in the British Museum. \n\nS.T.C, 25147.

Rep.X11, App.1X, pp.151-2, was taken from the end of a volume of manuscripts and was \n\u201cto be bound separately, for the inspection of Mr. Payne Collier, June 15, 1836\". \n\nPROVENANCE: This manuscript was once the property of Sir Henry Spelman (1564-1641), the \nantiquary, and passed, at one of his sales in 1709 or 1710, to the Rev. Cox Macro (1683-1767). \nMacro\u2019s manuscripts came into the possession of John Pattenson, M.P. for Norwich, and were \nsold through Christie\u2019s in 1820f at which time the volumes of autograph letters were acquired by \nDawson Turner, and the rest, including the present, by Hudson Gurney. It remained in the \npossession of the Gurney family until sold at Sotheby\u2019s, 30 March 1936, Lot 140. \n\nCouzation: 18; 2-34; 48; s4.tt \n\n  \n\nCowrewrs: heading, as above, see Plate No.XIX, recto first leaf The partes and names of the \nplaiers, recto first; The prologue, first leaf; text, recto second-recto twenty-eighth; blank, verso \ntwenty-eighth. \n\nRespublica has been called the most important of the Tudor controversial interludes. \nIt is true that such interludes, though once apparently numerous, are now known \n\nfFol.1-359 contained the Glossarium originale de Johannis de Laet and miscellaneous manuscript collections, \ntranscripts of charters, genealogies, and other material of antiquarian interest. That portion was broken \ninto two lots when sold in the Gurney sale\u2014Nos.14 and 156, the latter now in the Norwich Public \nLibrary. \nhe sale of the Macro MSS. was advertised in \u2018A catalogue of ancient manuscripts chiefly antiquarian and \nhistorical including the valuable collections of Sir Henry Spelman, Knt,, . . \u00ab the whole formerly collected \nby the Rev.Dr. Macro of Little Haugh (Norton) in the county of Suffolk, which are to be sold by private \ncontract by Mr. Christie, Pall-Mall\u2019 (Norwich, Stevenson, Matchett, and Stevenson, February 1820, 4\u00b0). \nPp.8-12 contain a description of the \u2018Original MSS, of Sir Henry Spelman, Knt. comprised in 18 folio \nvolumes\u2019. The present was formerly contained in Volume 12, described pp.11-12. \nThe collation here given is based upon the watermarks. In the third quire the sewing occurs after the \nthird leaf. \n\nVOL. [ 531 ]\n\nmainly by title. But in the present instance not even the title would have been pre- \nserved had not this manuscript survived the seventeenth century. The loss, in this \ntase, would have been substantial for the vigor of the denunciations of the rapacity and \nanarchy which in the reign of the last Henry and his son hid under the guise of religion \nsnake some passages attain almost to the height of real literature. In fact, perusal \ninclines one to take rather seriously the ascription of it by L.A.Magnus to Nicholas \nUdall, Prof, Leicester Bradner has given further proof for this ascription based on \nmetrical tests (M.L.N. XLII, 1927, pp-378-380)- His results provide a remarkable \ncoincidence, if not final proof, and should be further checked. \n\u2018The present manuscript Brandl, followed by later authorities, believes to be not the \noriginal author's copy but one made by a careless scribe who has mangled some of the \nrhymes, and omitted a few lines. But whether the author's copy or not, it is a remark- \nably well-preserved relic of the Christmas celebration before Queen Mary in 1553. \nRespublica has been printed from transcripts of this MS. by J.P.Collier, Illustrations \nof Old English Literature 1866, Vol-I; by Prof. Alois Brandl, Quellen des weltlichen \nDramas in England vor Shakespeare 1904; by Leonard A.

Tissier\u2019s Thersites was \nfirst printed in his Dialogi 1530. \nThe date of adaptation or translation of this pseudo-Homeric play is fixed by a \nprayer for Prince Edward, born 12th October 1537, and Queen Jane Seymour, died \n2gth October 1537 (Chambers Mediaeval Stage I1, 214, 456). A-R.Moon (Trans. Vi, \n1926-7, 184-193) has conjectured that Nicholas Udall was the translatort, that it was \nprepared for the birth of Prince Edward but on account of the untimely death of the \nQueen was not performed until about two months later when Udall brought his Eton \nboys to London where they produced it before Cromwell (Chambers op. cit. II, 196). \nBoas sought to prove in his University Drama in the Tudor Age that this is the earliest \nplay which was acted at Oxford. The final proof of these interesting conjectures has \nyet to be made but, at any rate, this comedy possesses considerable merit and marks \na point in the progress of the English drama. \nOnly two other copies of this interlude are known, the Egerton Brydges-Inglis-Heber- \nDevonshire-Huntington copy and the Mostyn (apparently \u2018bought-in\u2019 1 June 1907, Lot \n469, by Davies and resold 21 March 1919, Lot 333) copy owned by A.Edward Newton. \nAn effort was made to secure the latter by subscription for the Bodleian. \n\nfIt has been suggested also that Jasper Heywood was the translator but that is impossible as he was but \ntwo years old in 1537. \n\nS.T.C. 23949.

From the heading \nto the prologue, \u2018Doe all thinges to edifie the Congregation\u2019, the author would appear \nto have been a Calvinist of some complexion. \n\nHowever, a note from the Huntington Library states that their copy has a different printer's device (McK. \n1.161) on verso of title from the present and other copies. If that is so it is an earlier use of that size of \nthe device than is recorded by Dr. McKerrow. \nIt may be of interest to note that Purfoot had a smaller copy of the device here used, McK.n.151, \nmeasuring 80 x 55 mm., which he used in Desainliens he pretie and wittie historie of Arnalt and Lucenda \n1575 (verso eighth preliminary leaf). \n\nS.T.C.24271.

In the same year \nthat this was issued, King James, by proclamation, checked the persecution which had \nbeen gathering strength in Scotland since the trial of Dr. Fian in 1590. The book itself \nis, as Professor Kittredge has said, \u2018proof of what James thought, not of what he did\u2019 \nalthough the knowledge of the king\u2019s thoughts on this subject may have stimulated \nhis officers to greater zeal. \nIt has been stated, but without citation of authority, that in his later life the king \nregretted the publication of this book and nearly renounced his faith in witchcraft. \nBut whether he did or not, he evidently had nothing to do with the London editions \npublished upon his accession. They were quite obviously mere booksellers\u2019 speculations, \nbeing, in that respect, somewhat unlike the 1603 editions of the Basilikon Doron for \nwhich James prepared a greatly altered text and which doubtless were intendedtt as \npropaganda for the Scottish succession. \n\ntfIn the correspondence between Cecil and King James at that time there is no reference to this altered text, \nHowever, the nature of the alterations as well as the effect of the publication\u2014 Bishop Spottiswood wrote \nthat it was more valuable than all the writings of all the others who wrote in support of the Stuart succes- \nsion\u2014was such as to leave small doubt of the purpose for which it was prepared. On the other hand, the \ndate of publication in Edinburgh, which can be fairly definitely ascertained, and the probable date of \nrepublication in London lead one to suspect that the book could not long have been in circulation before \nthe Queen was dead and that its main effect was to acquaint the English people with the political views \nof their new sovereign. \n\nS.T.C. 14364.

Alexander Tragedie of Darius. \nHAs recorded in de Ricci\u2019s English Collectors, Miss Henrietta C, Bartlett discovered that the plays in the Inglis \ncollection sold 12th April 1826 were all uniformly bound, usually in straight-grain green morocco with a \ncenter medallion of four acorns. It now seems not unlikely that the present binding is typical of a number \nof books sold in the second Inglis sale, 9th June 1826. The Inglis (Lot 1369)-McKee-Winans-Jones copy \nof Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar 1597 now at the Rosenbach Co. isin this same binding and we have seen \nseveral books in red straight-grain morocco, similarly tooled, all of which can be traced to that sale. \n\nVoL.Ir [ 539]\n\nAccorbinc to the author\u2019s addresses these pieces were written some years before they \nwere here published. In 1589, Richard Field obtained a manuscript, possibly through \nVautrollier, and made an entry in the Stationers\u2019 Register (Arber II.527) for the \nprinting of this collection although he seems not to have acted upon it. Later, when \nWaldegrave attempted to export copies of this edition to London they were seized and \ntaken to the Company's Hall where, apparently, they remained until during the excite- \nment of James\u2019s ascension to the English throne [Matthew ?] Lownes thought well \nenough of them as a speculation to pay five shillings to the Company for fifteen copies. \n\u2018At the same time Henry Hooke and Simon Stafford entered for the Lepanto and the \nFuries to be published \u2018eyther in part or in wholle\u2019 (Arber I11.232) and actually pub- \nlished the Lepanto under the title \u2018His Majesties Lepanto, or Heroicall Song . . . \"fa. \nJohn Hawarde in his manuscript Les Reportes del Cases in Camera Stellata (Baildon \np.i79) noted that \u2018Nothinge now was talked of but the religion, vertue, wisedome, \nlearninge, Justice, & manye other most noble & woorthye prayses of K.James, . \nhis bookes neu printed, (Bazilikon Doron, Freen monarchies, Monologie, Expositions \nupon the Reuelations & the Kings, the Lepanto)\u2019. In 1604, it was also published in a \nLatin paraphrase (see S.T.C. 14366 and 18298). \n\u2018The later vogue of Du Bartas in England would seem to have received its inspiration \nfrom King James\u2019s admiration of the French poet. \n\n\u00a7For the seizure see Arber 11.38, and for the purchase see Greg Records of the Court of the Stationers 1576-1602 \n\nP.93- \nfaThe only copy recorded appears to be the Bindley-Heber (IV, 1834, Lot 1189)-Britwell copy which \napparently is still at Britwell Court, \n\n8.T.C. 14379.

Exercises [q.v.] James promised to bring forth his translation of the \nPsalms if that work should be well received. He never fulfilled that promise but after \nhis death Charles induced Sir William Alexander, who had collaborated with James in \nthe versification, to prepare the book for publication and in return granted Sir William \na patent giving him the sole right for thirty-one years of \u2018printing or causing to be \nprinted these Psalmes'f. Doubtless in giving this privilege the king recognized the \nproportion of James to Alexander. The King also decreed, as may be seen in the \nfrontispiece proclamation, that this version might be sung in all churches, and he \nfurther commanded that the bishops introduce it into all the schools. In December \n1634, Charles I \u2018being fully convinced of the exactnesse\u2019 of this translation, enjoined \nthe Privy Council of Scotland \u2018that no other Psalmes of any edition whatsoever, be \neither printed heireafter within that our Kingdome, or imported thither . . . \u2019. Despite \nall this, the sales cannot have been very great. \nThere is an undated octavo edition} which is sometimes said to be the first edition. \nIt has the same engraved title and frontispiece as the present though slightly worn. It \ncontains the much altered and improved text of the 1636 folio edition together with \nthe \u2018Authorized\u2019 prose version printed in the margins in the manner of the 1637 \nduodecimo edition with which it is probably contemporary. It may possibly be the \npirated edition issued by Harper in 1636-7 concerning which see the Stationers\u2019 unpub- \nlished Court-Book C 142b and 148a. \nThere is a copy of the present edition in the Huntington Library, formerly in the \ncollection of Sir John Arthur Brooke, which is remarkable for having the title headings \nof the three books into which this volume is divided printed in gold from the same \ntypes as were used in the ordinary impression. Whether this was an experimental issue \nor a special one for presentation purposes cannot be determinedt{. \n\nfAccording to Sir Roundel Palmer only 31 Psalms were completed at the time of James's death. Charles I \nwrote to the Archbishop of St. Andrews (Laing Baillie's Letters II, 530) 25 August 1626: \u2018We have gevin \ncommandement to. . .

There is no octavo edition dated 1631. \n#Gold printing at this time was certainly uncommon in English printing. The only other instance of which \nwe have found record occurs in Alexander Constable's copy (1827, Lot 252) of Darcie\u2019s translation of \nCamden Annales 1625 in which the dedication was so printed. Darcie\u2019s book is otherwise remarkable as \ncopies are known in an elaborate \u2018publisher's binding\u2019 containing a portrait of Elizabeth. \n\nS.T.C. 2732; 14389. Huntinoton C.L., 233.

Nevertheless, James already had issued three proclamations, an augury of \nhis later obsession for that means of governing which finally brought forth the Parlia- \nmentary protest of 1628. His first proclamation, issued sth April 1603, continued the \nroyal officers in authority and was necessary as the inter-regnum government was \nentirely extra-legal.

Of the first edition \nof Part I, 1596, the imperfect Sotheby\u2019s 1905-Perry-Huntington copy (see Hazlitt VI, \n1903, p-208) is the only one known; and of the first edition of Part II, 1597, only the \nHeber-Britwell-British Museum copy can be traced. Of the second edition of both parts, \n1608, three copies are known, viz. the British Museum (Halliwell-Ouvry-Lilburn), the \nWood (in vellum, sold March 1891), and the Harmsworth (Corser-Britwell). Of the \nthird edition, [16164], of which this present is a paginary reprint only the Gordonstoun- \nInglis-Utterson copy in the British Museum can be traced while of the present there \nare copies in the British Museum (Grenville, Part I only), the Huntington (Church), \nthe Newberry, and the Folger Libraries\u2014the two last apparently being defective. \nIn 1623, Roger Daniel issued a set of seven engraved plates, with a title, evidently \nintended to illustrate this book. It is not known whether they were for a projected \nedition which was not published, because the only set which can be traced is that \n\nmounted in a small folio volume in the Huntington Library (sold Sotheby's April 1913, \nand again at the Shakespeare sale 1918). \n\n{That edition has been dated 1612 from the date of Snodham\u2019s entry, but it is actually dated \u201822 May 1616\" \nat the end of the text.

Wood \nsuggests a Robert Johnson who was made Bachelor of Arts in 1598 and subsequently \ntook other degrees; he also mentions another scholar of that name, A.B. in 1599 (Bliss \nFasti 1.278 and 292, and Ath. 11.586). W.L.MacDonald (Englische Studien, Ixiv,44-5), \non the other hand, is inclined to identify our author with the arch-deacon of Leicester \nof that name (1540-1630), from his connection with the Bacon family and the aristo- \ncratic tone of his work. In any case, he probably is not the Robert Johnson, grocer and \ndirector of the Virginia Company, who wrote two apologies for that company (both in \nthis collection) though he may be the translator of Botero\u2019s Relationi uniuersali 1601. \nThis little book is of considerable importance in the history of the English essay and, \nas might be expected from its size, is of equal rarity for only five other copies can be \nlocated, viz. the British Museum (Grenville, imperfect), Bodleian (Reed-Malone), \nEdinburgh University (Drummond), (?)Chatsworth, and Huntington (Bain-Church). \n\nS.T.C, 14695.

Ideally, one might expect to find six different combinations \nof the settings and states of this sheet alone but actually we have found, or seen \nrecorded, only four. However, if one computes the possible combinations one might \nfind of the several settings of the ten formes in this book, it is apparent that the \nproblem is too complicated to be investigated unless it were possible to gather together \nat one place at least a score of copies\u2014and doubtless it is not worth the trouble. \n\nS.T.C. 14699.

This play was not included among those transferred at that time probably because \nBurre had made no original entry for it. On the other hand, this play was included in \nthe 1616 folio and the present edition may perhaps be a piracy which was detected by \nStansby for on 4 July 1635 (Arber TV.342), he again entered this book possibly in order \nto prevent further infringement and after he had settled with Spencer. From that entry \nStansby\u2019s right to the title of this book is based on a \u2018noate\u2019 dated 10 June 1621 under \nthe hand of Walter Burre and Mathew Lownes, Warden. This record was probably \nmade at the time Stansby was bringing out Epicene 1620. \nIn any case, this edition is merely a reprint of the first except that the dedication \nis omitted and the statement \u2018And now Acted by his Maiesties Servants with great \nApplause\u2019 is added to the title. This statement is the more amazing as the printer has \nblindly reprinted just below it Jonson\u2019s quotation from Horacet which appeared on the \ntitle of the first edition. \n\nWhich may be translated: This does not please the rabhle, nor, in truth the aristocrats either, for now all \npleasure has gone from sound to untrustworthy eyes and vain show. \n\nS.T.C. 14760.

The Hagen (1918, Lot 680) copy with \nbookplate and note of purchase March 1907, and of binding January 1908 (the binders\u2019 signature \nis dated 1907). \n\nNo complete copy of the original state of this volume has been found although there \nare several copies, e.g. the Chew-Huntington and the Steeves-Chapin, which have some \nof the cancellanda not cut-out but slashed or so roughly torn away that some of the \ntext remains. From the evidence of those copies it is possible to describe with some \nconfidence the contents of the cancelled portions. But first it should be noted that the \ntwo sheets which were altered occur in the Masque of the Gypsies. This masque was \noriginally presented before James at Burley-on-the-Hill, 3 August 1621, and was so \n\n{The impression of the first state from which that reproduction was made shows the plate considerably \n\u2018more worn than it is in the present, \n\n[ 558]\n\nwell received that it was repeated at Belvoir two days later, and at Windsor the follow- \ning month. Each time it was repeated the text was altered and enlarged. Manuscript \ncopies of the various recensions evidently had been available for Benson and Crooke \nset-up the masque from a manuscript of the original version. Judging by the fact that \nno unmutilated copies are now traceable, before publication they procured a copy (it \nis not impossible that they used the text of the 1640 folio) of the more complete \nWindsor versiont. By cancelling D6-10 and Es-11 (Sig [E12] was a blank and is retained \nin some copies otherwise altered as the present), and substituting sheets d and e they \nmanaged substantially to convert the Burley-on-the-Hill text into the Windsor text. \nDr. George Watson Cole has recently published a variorum edition of the Masque of \nthe Gypsies which gives more complete information on these points. \nSuffice it to say that the present is a reprint of the Execration against Vulcan [q.v.] \ntogether with the eponymous translation, the Masque of the Gypsies, as well as sundry \nadditional Epigrams. Concerning the history of the publication of this volume as well \nas that of the Execration, see Workes, 1640tt. \nThe Locker copy contains two leaves of verses not in other copies. They were prob- \nably late insertions for the first sheet of that copy was apparently rearranged by the \nbinder. \n\nFor example, the \u2018Fortunes\u2019 of the several Lords which were first included in the Windsor produetion form \nthe principal addition to the text of Sig D6-10 as reprinted in sheet d. \ntYAs a commentary on the editorial care with which these books were printed one may compare the heading \nof the Pindaric Ode which is entitled in the 1640 folio \u2018To the immortall memorie, and friendship of that \nnoble paire, Sir Lucius Cary, and Sir H.Morison\u2019, which in the Execration reads \u2018Ode Pindarick on the \nDeath of Sir Hen. Morison\u2019, while in the Horace it reads \u2018Ode Pindarick to the Noble Sir Lucius Cary\u2019. \n\nS.T.C. 13798. HUNTINGTON C.L., 241. GRouter Ciup L-W, 130, Hoe Car. III (1903), 14. \nHors Car.

However, the \nplacing of Jones\u2019s name on the title of this work, a distinction which up to that time \nJonson had never conceded, was not enough to satisfy the swelling pride and self- \nimportance of the artist who, it must be admitted, was really responsible for the effec- \n\n[ 560 ]\n\ntiveness of the production as an entertainment\u2014Jonson\u2019s work being much less color- \nful and decidedly feebler than in his earlier pieces. Jones was not satisfied with this \nconcession particularly as Jonson, sick and bed-ridden and no longer the person of \nimportance about the court of Charles that he had been at that of James, placed his \nown name, as a matter of course, first on the title (see Ciloridia). Jones resented the \nslight and so the final rupture between the two was brought about and the following \nChristmas season, 1631-2, \u2018Jonson\u2019s services, at Inigo\u2019s direct urgency, were dispensed \nwith, and Aurelian Townshend, a third-rate poet about the Court, was called on for a \nmasque in his stead\u2019. Jonson has left a record of his feelings in his Epigrams on Jones \nand in the Expostulation. \nOnly four other copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum (Garrick), Bodleian \n(Heber), Huntington (Bridgewater), and the Arbury copy now at the Rosenbach \nCompany. \n\nS.T.C, 14776.

Inigo Jones was responsible for the \nattire of the Hags, and \u2018the invention and architecture of the whole scene and machine\u2019; \nAlphonso Ferrabosco for the airs of the songs; Thomas Giles for the third dance, and \nHicrome Herne for the dance of Hags.

Workes 1640) some personal allusion hidden \nin the seemingly innocent name of the Chambermaid, Cicely, caused the audience to \nbe much disturbed so that the author, who disclaims any intended injury in the epilogue \nwritten for the Court, altered the name to Prudence. However, this edition appears to \nhave been set-up from a manuscript which was only imperfectly corrected for in all \ncopies \u2018Cicelie\u2019 remains in the list of persons at the head of Act I, se. vi. Moreover, in \nthe same scene in some copies, e.g. the present, \u2018Cis\u2019 survives in the last line on verso \n{B7], the third, seventh and tenth lines on recto [B8], and \u2018Cicely\u2019 in the seventh from \nthe bottom line on the same page.

If that is true, then this volume originally was \nintended to end on Sig E which was cancelled and reset with the Panegyre added (E*, \nF?), But the signatures of that section seem to give weight to the suspicion that it was \nprinted by a different compositor from the sections before and after, which may perhaps \naccount for the abnormal format of Sig E. \n\u2018The magnificence and poetic quality of the entertainment provided as a welcome \nby the City to King James upon his first entrance did justice to the dignity of the \noccasion and has never, perhaps, been equalled in its combination of lavish expenditure, \nenthusiasm, and literary, or at least learned, symbolism and poetry. Jonson provided \nthe first and last of the series of pageants given at different points between the City and \nWhitehall; Dekker providing the rest (see his Magnificent Entertainment 1604). Many \nof the spectators, unless they belonged to the \u2018multitude\u2019 who \u2018did gaze, said it was \nfine, and were satisfied\u2019, must have wished that this book was already in print with \nits elaborate description of the arches at Fenne Church and at Temple Bar and their \n\u2018significations\u2019 and marginal notes interpreting the allusions and allegory of the \n\u2018Speeches\u2019, but it was not even entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register until four days \nafter the Entrance and is not likely to have been published before the 19th March \n1603-4 because it contains the Panegyre which Jonson composed for James when he \nopened Parliament on that day. \nThe entertainment at Althorpe which forms the third part of this work was given \nthe previous June by Sir Robert Spencer to the Queen and Prince Henry. \n\nS.T.C. 14756.

When it was produced not only \nthe rival playwrights against whom it was mainly directed were disturbed but also the \nsoldiers and lawyers who felt their professions to have been insulted. Jonson accordingly \nwrote an \u2018Apologetical Dialogue\u2019 which was\u2018. . . a manly and sufficient justification, \nbut so much like a repetition of the offence that it rather irritated than soothed the \nsmarting wounds, and, after a single performance, was prohibited\u2019. Even when, some \nmonths later, the present edition was published he was restrained, \u2018by authority\u2019, from \nappending that dialogue}. However, it was included in the 1616 folio along with a dedi- \ncation to Richard Martin who apparently had averted a threatened prosecution, prob- \nably in the Star Chamber, by the enemies whom Jonson\u2019s disparagement had aroused. \nOn recto Aq isa translation of Elegy 15, Book I of Ovid\u2019s Amores which had appeared, \nsigned \u2018B.I.\u2019, in Marlowe's translation of Al Ovia\u2019s Elegies (q.v.]. \nThis copy has the two corrected readings of the British Museum copy as noted by \nHerford and Simpson IV, 187; verso C line 6 \u2018rather\u2019, and verso D2 line 7 \u2018Mecenas\u2019. \nEight other copies can be located, viz. the British Museum (Garrick), Bodleian, \nDyce, Huntington (Bridgewater), Harvard (White), Wilmerding (Hoe-Clawson-Sny- \nder), Folger (Roxburghe-Jolley-Hazlitt-Sewall), and the Boston Public Library. \n\nIt is possible that it was actually set-up as part of sheet N for the single leaf N might otherwise have been \navoided by the compositor. \n\nS.T.C, 14781, AnBER III. 198 (see also IV. 176, 180, 205, 245, and Eyre I, 126).

Such copies were probably earliert than those reading \nas the present, \u2018Elid\u2019, by reason of the fact that the removal of the letter \u2018e\u2019 and the \nrespacing of the type left an awkward gap between \u2018by\u2019 and \u2018G.\u2019 (see facsimile noted \nbelow). \nThere are two states of the inner forme of sheet \u00a7t}.

That \u2018variant\u2019 is probably the result of an inaccuracy \nin the B.M.

That such a connection is other than accidental cannot, of course, be determined \nuntil all the extant copies, twenty-odd, have been examined. \nPhysically this book is of considerable interest. The title-page is set-up in a manner \nwhich may be described as Jonsonian. Then, too, the marginal notes give to the volume \nan air which to one familiar with the play only in Gifford\u2019s edition must be rather \nsurprising. Even the paper, or much of it, is somewhat unusual for it has a triple water- \nmark made-up of the royal initials I.R., A.R., and H.P. entwined in Jacobean lattice \nwork. \nThis is the first of Jonson\u2019s plays to have commendatory verses prefixed. Jonson \ncalls them \u2018voluntary labors\u2019 but they all agree in their efforts to show that the failure \non the stage was due to lack of discernment on the part of the audience. \nThe identity of the collaborator whose share Jonson tells us in the epistle he has \nreplaced with his own has not been solved. Nor has the \u2018poperie and treason\u2019 in the play \nwhich, according to Drummond, caused Jonson to be called before the Council been \npointed out. Doubtless in both cases the question is insoluble for the reason that the \ntext as printed is not that originally written. Perhaps it was one or the other of these \nmatters which delayed the publication for nearly a year after entry. \nIn the 1616 folio Jonson has appended to this tragedy a list of \u201cThe principall \nTragoedians\u2019 who \u2018first acted\u2019 it in 1603. With Burbadge\u2019s, at the head of that list, \nstands the name of \u2018Will.

[ 567]\n\nIr is not often that the rare-book world has the rather exciting thrill of learning of the \ndiscovery of an hitherto unknown edition of a work by a major writerf. Until the \nappearance of this copy of Time Vindicated in the New Bond Street rooms in 1930, it \nwas not known that this masque had been published prior to its inclusion in the 1640 \nfolio edition. \n\u2018The value and interest of this newly discovered book lies not so much in the fact \nthat it is the only copy known but rather because it presents several variant readings \nfrom the 1640 text, hitherto the sole authority. These variants are of particular interest \nbecause, as this quarto edition was printed in Jonson\u2019s lifetime, it may have been seen \nthrough the press by the author himself. \nFor example, the first line of the text reads in the quarto \u201cFAME. Give eare, the \nworthy, heare what Time proclaimes.\u2019; whereas in the folio Fame asks for attention \nto what she herself has to say. That emendation is rather gratuitous as, a few lines \nfurther on, Fame proclaims herself a messenger from Time. The tenth line of the text \n(recto A2) of the quarto, \u2018Is it not fo?\u2019, is omitted in the folio. The fifth line from the \nbottom of recto B in the quarto reads \u2018EARES. I, all difputing . . . \u2019; while in the \nfolio p.g7, line 21 it reads \u2018\u201cEARES. And all difputing . . . \u2019. The \u2018I\u2019 of the quarto is \nequivalent to \u2018Aye\u2019, see line 6 and 14, verso B. The last line of verso B3 in the quarto \nreads \u2018To keepe you in uxorious giues,\u2019; in the folio, due to the compositor\u2019s carelessness, \nthis line reads \u2018Yo keepe you inuxorious gives,\u2019. The stage direction on verso B of the \nquarto is recast in the folio in an effort, not very successful, to clarify it. In the quarto \nit reads \u2018The fecond Antimafque of Tumblers, and Iuglers, who abufe the Curious, and \ndriue them away: led in by the Cat and fiddle.\u2019; while in the folio the last clause is placed \nafter \u2018Fuglers\u2019 and reads \u2018brought in by the Cat and fiddle.\u2019. Likewise the stage-direction \non verso Bg of the quarto ends \u2018. . . HIPPOLITUS.\u2019; in the folio the note con- \ntinues\u2018. . . , the whole Scene being chang\u2019d to a Wood, out of which he [Hippolitus] \ncomes.\u2019. This addition may have been made by Digby, the editor, on the strength of a \nmanuscript note in the quarto which he was using but more likely was suggested by the \nreference a few lines below to \u2018yond\u2019 groues\u2019. \nThese alterations are the more important but do not by any means exhaust the list \nof changes in spelling, punctuation and typography. The differences are about equally \ndivided between genuine corrections, corruptions, and changes due to the orthographic \npractice of the office of the printer of the folio edition. \nThe discovery of this separate edition is also of interest because it naturally arouses \nthe suspicion that some of the other Twelfth Night masques of which separate editions \nare not known were actually so issued. There seems to be some ground for suspecting at \nleast one, the Twelfth Night masque for 1621\u2014 Newes from the New World. The evi- \ndence upon which this conjecture is based introduces the matter of the rather unusual \narrangement of the title-page of the present, see Plate No.X XIII. In common with the \n\n  \n\nSuch an experience occurred in 1905 when the unique copy of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus was \ndiscovered in Sweden and passed to Mr. Folger, but, although one might list several other similar occa~ \nsions, they are certainly infrequent, \n\n[ 568 ]\n\nCO LaF \n\nTIME \n\n|: \n2} VINDICATED \n\nay \n? \n\nao \n\ni ggk O HIMSELFE, \u00a9 \n\n  \n\n; \u201c= AND \na TO HIs HONORS.",

Seventeenth century \nsignatures, \u201cGuil: Haruey\u2019, and \u2018Guy Hill\u2019; scribbling on title. \nThe Harvey signature is probably that of the author of De mortu cordis. It would appear to be \nan early one, near the date of publication of this play, for it resembles Harvey's signature on \nthe title of his holograph Praelectiones 1616 (in the British Museum) much more closely than it \ndoes any of the signatures reproduced in J.H.Aveling\u2019s Memorial of Harvey 1875, which all date \nabout 1630-1643. It would be difficult to name a play more likely to have been read by Harvey \nthan the present. \nHarvey's autographs are remarkably scarce, only about twenty being known\u2014the example in \nthe Maine Historical Society Library is the sole example recorded in America. A copy of Fuchus\u2019s \nherbal in the library of the Royal College of Physicians is the only other book known with his \nsignature although one or two books have been found with his \u2018q.e.d.\u2019 mark. The present signa- \nture appears to be the only one known in a private collectiont. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIw a few copies, e.g. the Ashley and the White copy sold in 1920, the inner forme of \nsheet A was set-up in such a way as would seem to indicate an error in perfectingtt \nrather than wrong imposition were it not that, though the letterpress of the present \nrecto A2 occurs on recto [Aq], the signature is in the proper position on recto A2, below \nthe text of the present [Aq]. That such copies represent an earlier state of sheet A than \n\nfit should be noted, however, that when Mr, White disposed of some duplicates at Anderson's 6 February \n1920, he included a copy of this play, Lot 56, which is described as \u2018full sprinkled calf . . . Signature of \nGuil. Harvey on title . . . \u2019. As in his Handlist 1914, p.2s, two copies are listed with the note \u2018one has \nGabriel [sic] Harvey's signature\u2019, the 1920 entry was presumably an error. \n4A document signed by Harvey, now untraced, was offered by Pearson & Co. in 1910. \n\nHHLe., the sheet was turned about, top for bottom, so that the contents of verso [A3] occur on verso [Als \nrecto A2 on recto [Aj]; and vice versa, \n\n[570]\n\ndoes the present may be seen from the fact that in them the dramatis personae and the \nargument are separated, unnaturally, from the prologue. \n\u2018An unsigned leaf containing verses addressed \u2018To the worthiest Maister Ionson\u2019 and \nsigned \u2018N{at].

Inserted as \nfrontispiece is an impression of the third state of Vaughan\u2019s portrait of Jonson which belongs to \nthe second edition of this volume, 1640 (see Execration 1640). \n\n\u2018Te bibliographical variations of this book are bewildering and, although we have \nexamined some twenty copies, all attempts to simplify them into categories have not \nmaterially reduced the confusion. For example, while it is possible to roughly distin- \n\n{The idea of this design, possibly furnished by Jonson himself, as Sir Sidney Colvin suggests, is scholarly to \nthe point of pedantry but the plate is quaint and not unattractive, \n\n[572]\n\nguish two major classes, namely, the large-papert and the small-paper copies, it will \nbe found that in many instances where there is more than one setting of a given sheet \none of those settings will occur always in large-paper as well as sometimes in small- \npaper copies. However, since the converse does not seem to occur, these two classes, \nlarge and small-paper, may be termed \u2018issues\u2019 in a broader sense than mere distinction \nof size. \nThe alterations in the large-paper present the later state not only on account of the \nnature of the changes themselves, as Dr. Greg has pointed out, but from the fact that \nirregularities in the type in small-paper, when not deliberately set right, appear on the \nwhole exaggerated in the large-paper. It is apparent, from the imprints peculiar to the \nseparate titles of the large-paper that such copies were the concern of Stansby alone, \nthough he may not have had any for sale but solely for the author\u2019s use. \nJonson began the preparation of this definitive edition in 1612. He used the quarto \ntexts wherever available but scrupulously and systematically revised them, cutting \nout many marginal notes, altering the spelling, typography, and punctuation in accord- \nance with a consistent if somewhat pedantic plan and introducing considerable edi- \ntorial matter. The result is that this folio edition may be regarded as authoritative. \nMoreover, Jonson attended the press while it was being printed and introduced many \ncorrections and alterations at that time. This circumstance has further complicated \nthe variations for, as was the customary practice, the corrected and uncorrected sheets \nof the same size were gathered indiscriminately}. The press-corrections are not given \nin the list of variants which follows: \nThe engraved title is known in three states\u00a7. \u2018There is little evidence for assigning any particu- \nlar order to them but the following seems probable. The variations all occur in the imprint. \n(A) In what may be the earliest it reads: LONDON | printed by W: | Stansby and are | to be \n\u2018fould by | Rich. Meighen | An? D. 1616 |. This state is found only in small-paper copies and is \nthe most common. \n(B) In what appears to be a later state (eg. the present) it reads: LONDON | Printed dy | Wil- \nliam | Stanfby | An\u00ae D. 1676. |. This is usually found in small-paper copies which have some \nof the characteristics of large-paper. In our experience this is the rarest of the states. \n(C) The third(2) state which is found in all recorded large-paper copies as well as in some \u2018small- \npaper reads: Imprinted at | London by | Will Stansby. | An? D. 1676. |. \n\u2018The title to Every Man Out of his Humour (recto G, p.{73}) is known in four states. In two, it \nis in compartment, McK. and F.n.224, while in the others there is no border. Copies having this \n\n{Copies on large-paper are in the British Museum (Grenville), Huntington (Griswold-Hoe), W.A.Clarke \n(Huth-Chew), Folger (Marquis of Stafford; ?Holford), Elizabethan Club (Dent-Gott), Morgan (Sotheby's \n1908, presentation copy), Crocker (Plowman-Britwell), and at the Rosenbach Company (Ashburnham. \nWhite, presentation copy). Others are listed in Dobell\u2019s Cat. 124 (1933) Lot 188, and in Robinson's Cat, \n55 (1935). The tallest of these copies is the Crocker which measures 1314 inches. \nHLA comparison of two copies with variant readings of Every Man Out of his Humor as given by [Herford \nand] Simpson confirms this statement. \n$A fourth state occurs in the second edition, 1640: the first \u201c\" in \nre-engraved to read: LONDON. | Printed dy | Richard Bifhop, \nin S* Paules, | Churchyard, | An\u00ae D. 1640. |. \n\nVOL.

One of the two states without border occurs in some small-paper \ncopies; in it the imprint reads: LONDON, | Printed by WILLIAM STANSBY. | for Zohn \nSmithwicke. | [rule] | M.DC.XVI. |. The other state without border occurs in the large-paper and \na few small-paper copies, e.g. the present; in it the imprint reads: LONDON, | Printed by \nWILLIAM STANSBY. | [rule] | M.DC.XVI. |. There are other differences in these states. \nSig [G6], conjugate with \u00a3.M.0.H. title, and also sheet G2 and [5] have variations. They appear \nto be the result of two distinct settings with alterations in the press. In the first, found only in \nsmall-paper copies, the dedication, recto Ga, is signed \u2018By your true Honorer, BEN. JONSON\u2019; \nline 6 on verso reads \u2018PVNTERVOLO . . . \u2019; the catchword on recto [Gs] is \u2018Naked\u2019, on verso \n\u201cWhere's recto [G6] begins \u2018Where I want arte . . . \u2019; and the eighth line from bottom on verso \n[G6] reads: \u2018But why enforce I this, as fainting? no.\u2019. In some copies of this setting a stage direc- \ntion, ninth line from bottom of verso [Gs], is omitted. In the other setting which occurs in all \nlarge-paper and in some small-paper copies, eg. the present, the dedication (recto G2, here \nmisnumbered 81) is signed \u2018By your honourer, BEN. IONSON\u2019; line 6 on verso reads \u2018PVN- \nTARVOLO . . . \u2019; three lines at the foot of recto [Gs] have been moved to the top of verso, and \ntwo lines at foot of verso [G5] are placed at top of recto [G6] and the catchword on recto [Gs] \nis \u2018To\u2019, on verso \u2018Like\u2019; recto [G6] begins \u2018Like fome drie braine, . . . \u2019; and the eighth line \nfrom bottom on verso [G6] reads: \u2018But why enforce I this? as fainting? No.\u2019. The stage direction \nmentioned above is here omitted. There are numerous other differences between the two settings. \nThe title to Cynthia's Revels (recto [Ps], p.[17]) is known in two states. In most small-paper \ncopies it is in compartment, McK. and F.n.224, with imprint: LONDON, | Printed by #. \n\u2018Stansby. | 1616. |. In all the large-paper, and some small-paper copies, e.g. the present, it is \nwithout the border and with imprint: LONDON, | Printed by WILLIAM STANSBY. | [rule] | \n\u2018M.DC.XVI. |. \nThe title to Po\u00e9taster (recto [Z4], p.[271]) is known in three states. In one, found only in small- \npaper copies, e.g. the present, itis in compartment, McK. and F.n.224, with imprint: LONDON, | \nPrinted by #.Stansby, | for M.Lownes. | 1616. |. In other small-paper copies it is entirely reset, \nwithout the border and the imprint: LONDON, | Printed by WILLIAM STANSBY, | for \nMatthew Lownes.| {rule | M.DC.XVI. |. In all large-paper copies the third line of the imprint is \nomitted so that it reads: LONDON, | Printed by WILLIAM STANSBY. | [rule] | M.DC.XVI. |. \nQuire Yy\u00ae (pp.s29-540) is known in two settings which appear to be peculiar to the sizes. \n\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nSMALL-PAPER LARGE-PAPER \nPage 529, heading, line 1 [measures 103 mm.] [measures 67 mm.] \nPage 530, line 3 ++. ord\u2019naries, .. , . + + ordinaries, ... \nPage 531, line 6 ++. gallant, ... + Gallant, . \nPage 532, linet 2s anor | \u00ab+ \u00ab Collegiates, | \nPage $33, \u2014 catchword MOROSE\u2019S moft \nPage 534, begins MOROSE\u2019S windore ... \u2014-moft bleeding . . . \nPage 535, line 2 ++ one that | ++. all] \nPage 536, line 8 \u00ab . \u00ab is not for | . \u00ab \u00ab is not for fe- | \nPage 537, line 7 cee ae wether \nPage 538, lines 2+ Europe... ...

In small-paper \ncopies the song headed Astrea is first and that headed Pallas is second; in the large-paper, this \norder is reversed. \nAcopy sold at Anderson\u2019s 11 March 1930, Lot 176, has the outer forme of sheet H blank. That \nwas undoubtedly an error in perfecting and, very likely, does not exist in another copy. \nAs this volume does not contain any material of later date than 1612, it is believed \nthat the printing was begun at that time. The delay in publication may have been due \nto the fact that Stansby was then engaged with the printing of Raleigh\u2019s History and \nwas not able to carry on two such large pieces of work more expeditiously \u2014the date \nof the entries in the Stationers\u2019 Register for several of the pieces included in the present \nhelp to confirm this theory. Though Stansby\u2019s name appears on the general-title as \nthe printer of this volume he was also partly responsible as publisher. Seven of the \nplays were the copyright of Walter Burreta with whom Stansby was associated in the \nRaleigh venture. \nThe copyright to Every Man Out of his Humour was the property of John Smeth- \nwicke who presumably acquired it from Nicholas Ling\u2019s estate though it is not included \nin the entry of 19 November 1607 which records the transfer of several copies from \nthat source. This play was later, 28 April 1638 (Arber IV.417) assigned to Richard \nBishop. The Poetaster belonged to Matthew Lownes by virtue of original entryta, \nwhile the King\u2019s Entertainment and the Althrop Entertainment belonged to Edmund \nBlount for the same cause. This last, however, may have been privately acquired by \nStansby for these Entertainments when included in this edition do not have Blount\u2019s \nname on their titles while the Poetaster and E.M.O.H. have their respective copy- \nholder\u2019s names given as publishersffa. The two masques of Blacknesse and Beauty may \nalso have belonged to another publisher besides Stansby and Burre\u2014Thomas Thorpe, \nwho made the original entry for them\u2014but, as in the case of the Entertainments, the \nrights to these pieces may have been privately acquired by Stansby for Thorpe\u2019s name \nis not given in this edition and no other transfer of them is recorded in the Register. \nStansby made an entry for such of Jonson\u2019s masques as were not printed, 20 January \n1615. \n\nfaThese seven were later transferred to Stansby \u2018und\u00e9r note bearing date roth June 1621\u2019 (4 July 1635, \nArber 1V.342). This entry presumably cancelled the one made to John Spencer for the Alchemist, Cynthias \nRevels, and the Silent Woman, 3 July 1630 (Arber IV.238). Stansby\u2019s rights which then must have included \nnearly all of this volume were finally transferred to Bishop ( March 1639, Arber IV.460) who published \nthe 1640 edition, \ntaFor the later history of this copyright see Arber IV.176, 180, 205, and 245; Eyre I, 126. \nthaFor a somewhat similar collected edition made-up of pieces belonging to more than one publisher, see \n\nSpenser's works, 1611. \n\n  \n\nWIpENER \n\n  \n\nS.T.C. 14751.

The several parts have been arranged \nhaphazardly by the binder. \n\nTue three plays of Volume II were all that Jonson saw through the press of a projected \ncontinuation of his 1616 volume. His failure to complete the collection was probably \ndue to the damning by the town of The New Inn which was published 1631, the same \nyear as this volume. Because of Jonson\u2019s supervision of this part, the text here given \nmay be considered authoritative. \nAs first printed Sig [A] was a blank, there being no general-titlet. In 1640, a number \nof these 1631 plays still remaining unsold, sheet [Ar and 6] was again passed through \n\n{General-title, by Bernard Alsop and Thomas Fawcett for Richard Meighen; Part I, by J[ohn. Bleale). for \nRobert Allot, 1631; Parts II-IV, [by Bernard Alsop and Thomas Fawcett for Thomas Walkley], 1640-1. \nCopies in that state are in the Huntington (Hoe), in the possession of Dr.W.W.Greg (see Oxford Biblio- \ngraphical Society Trans. I, 259), at the Rosenbach Company (Bridgewater-Huntington-White), and \nanother\u2014 presented by Digby to Elizabeth of Bohemia\u2014listed in Dobell Cat.84 (1929) No.177. This last \nhas a general-title supplied by Mr. Dobell. \n\n[ 576]\n\nthe press, this time of Bernard Alsop and Thomas Fawcett, and the general-title, tran- \nscribed above, printed on recto [A]. This title refers only to the three plays printed in \n1631 and describes them as \u2018The fecond Volume\u2019. However, bound with these three \n1631 plays are normally found the three parts containing the masques, plays and \nmiscellany dated 1640 (or 1641) which have no general-title nor any other preliminary \nmatter. \n\u2018The fact that over a period of years the 1631 plays may have been sold as a supple- \nmentary volume to the 1616 Workes (the Huth-Chew-W.A.Clark large-paper copy is \nan example) would easily account for their being described as the second volume quite \naside from the explicit statement of the 1640 general-title. \nIt is a matter of record that Parts I-IV were known as \u2018The Third Volume\u2019 for \nMoseley in the preface to his edition of Suckling\u2019s Remains 1659 states that The Sad \nShepherd is \u2018extant in his [Jonson\u2019s] Third Volume\u2019, and in 1658 when Walkley entered \nthe rights to Parts IT-IV (Eyre Il, 196) the copy is entitled \u201cBen Johnsons workes ye \ngrd vol. . =\u2019. \nExternal evidence which has only recently come to light in the form of a Chancery \nBill (transcribed by Mr. Frank Marcham Trans. XI, 1930, p.2a5, and discussed by \nDr.W.W.Greg op. cit. pp.461-5) affords at least a starting point for conjecture con- \ncerning the peculiar features of this book. The newly discovered document is a petition, \ndated 20 January 1640-1, made for Thomas Walkley, the publisher, to Sir Edward \nLittleton, Lord Keeper. In it Walkley alleges that before his death Jonson delivered \ntrue and perfect copies of his several writings and works not before printed to Sir \nKenelm Digby to whose care and trust he left the publishing and printing. In pursu- \nance of this trust, after Jonson\u2019s death, Digby turned these manuscripts over to \nWalkley for publication. Walkley obtained license for their publication and arranged \nfor the printing. Meanwhile John Benson and Andrew Crooke secured unauthorized \nmanuscripts of some of Jonson\u2019s works and entered them at Stationers\u2019 Hall. Hearing \nof this Walkley obtained a warrant prohibiting Benson and Crooke from further print- \ning or publishing these works. His triumph was short-lived for another publisher, John \nParkertt, with the connivance of Benson and Crooke, attached at the printer's the \nsheets of Walkley\u2019s edition, by judgment at Guildhall, upon the grounds that Benson \nand Crooke owned the copyright and that Benson was in debt to him, the said Parker. \nFor the redress of this injury Walkley complains. \nWalkley\u2019s story, unless corroborated by independent evidence, would of course have \nlittle value. It happens, however, that in general it can be substantiated, and if credible \nit serves to make clear several matters hitherto obscure which were not directly involved \nin these lawsuits, Taking his assertions in the order narrated above, it appears that, \nfirstly, as regards the connection of Digby with this publication, there is other con- \ntemporary authority, for Moseley who later owned the copyright in this work, in the \npreface cited above, states that Digby was responsible for publication of part of this \n\ntile may be worthy of note that Parker leftin his will a gold ring to Andrew Crooke, and that in 164 Parker \nbecame a Warden of the Stationers\u2019 Company. \n\nVOL.IT [577]\n\n1640 volume\u00a7. Secondly, regarding the \u2018corrupt\u2019 and unauthorized \nby Benson there is evidence extant in the texts of his editions of Q.Horatius Flaccus: \nhis Art of Poetry (q.v.] and Execration (q.v.]. Thirdly, as to the entries for books by \nJonson made by Benson and Crooke prior to the date of this petition Arber\u2019s Tran- \nscript provides evidence which supports Walkley\u2019s story. According to Walkley, it was \nnot until his edition was partly printed that Benson and Crooke made their entries. \n\u2018An examination of the Registers shows that during the period thus prescribed Benson \nentered and published the \u2018Execration with other his smaller epigrams\u2019 (16 December \n1639); the Art of Poetry (8 February 1640); and the Masque of the Gypsies (20 February \n1640)fa; while Crooke (in partnership with Sergier) entered the masques of Augurs, \nTime Vindicated, Neptune\u2019s Triumph, Pann's Anniversary and \u2018sundry Elegies & other \nPoems\u2019 (20 March 1640). \nThus, when checked by the available external evidence, Walkley\u2019s story can be \ncorroborated and from it we learn for the first time of the extent of the connection of \nboth Walkley and Crooke with the publication of this work. It is true that Walkley\u2019s \ninterest might have been inferred from his entry of 17 September 1658ta, as might \nCrooke\u2019s from the fact that in 1637 he had procured a transfer of the rights to Bar- \ntholomew Fayre and the Staple of Newes from the estate of Robert Allottta and thus, \nfrom his ownership of the rights to the masques previously noted, held considerable \nrights in Jonson\u2019s works. But such entries unless supported by evidence of continued \nownership must always be contingent upon possible unregistered private transfer. \nCrooke\u2019s name appears as agent on the title of the second edition of Volume I \n(1640) of Jonson\u2019s works, but until the discovery of this Bill the only link associating \nBenson with Crooke in the publication of Jonson\u2019s collected works was the fact that \nthe plate of Vaughan\u2019s portrait of Jonson was used in books with which their names were \nindividually connected, see Execration. Now, with the evidence to be derived from \nWalkley\u2019s complaint, there can be no doubt that Crooke in 1640 still retained his \ncopyright in the two plays, a fact which is of particular significance for from it may \nbe deduced a fairly plausible explanation of the puzzling format of this volume. \nTo begin with, the three plays dated 1631, all purport to be printed by \u2018Jfohn]. \nBleale]. for Robert Allot\u2019 and so, from the typographical evidence, they undoubtedly \nwere. The three parts bound after the 1631 plays were anonymously printed but the \nornaments used were at that time in the possession of Bernard Alsop and Thomas \nFawcett who also, from the device McK.n.339, apparently printed the general-title\u00a7z. \nThen, continuing, we find that the second part, unlike all the others, begins with Sig B \n\u00a7Quoted in Greg Masques p.xv. Moreover, the presentation copy noted above is inscribed in Digby's well- \nknown hand. \naSee also entry under 4 November 1639. \nfaEyre II, 196; transferred 20 November 1658, II, 206; retransferred IT, 381. \nHaThese rights may be traced in the Registers (Arber V.156, 260, 388). John Legate Jr. was a partner of \n\nCrooke\u2019s in this last transaction but Crooke\u2019s partners in this affair seem to have played an insignificant \npart. \n\n\u00a7aSayle (11 No.g221) suggests that perhaps John Haviland printed Part II, the Masques portion. \n\n{578 ]\n\nso that one may suspect that at that point, at one time, it was intended to introduce \npreliminary matter. This is of interest from the fact that, as noted above, in the seven- \nteenth century the three 1631 plays were known as the second volume and the rest \nof the present volume [parts II-IV] was known, at least to the trade, as the third \nvolume. In some copies, for reasons detailed below, The Divell is an Asse occurs in an \nentirely new setting (from the ornaments printed by Thomas Harper), with imprint: \n\u2018Imprinted at London 1641\u2019. \nWhile it is difficult to determine how much is due to later sophistication and impos- \nsible to compute the comparative frequency of any given state, the various parts are \nnow found, and apparently were originally issued, in the following combinations: (a) \nthe 1631 plays alonetd; (b) the same with the 1640 general-title; (c) parts II-IV alone, \nwithout a general-title; (d) as the present, 1631 plays with the general-title and parts \nIL-IVi4; (e) as in \u2018d\u2019 but with the 1641 reprint of Divell is an Asse substituted for the \noriginal of 1631; and (f) as in \u2018c\u2019 with the 1641 reprint of D. is an A. \nThe three 1631 plays bound separately without the general-title (a) were probably \nissued in that form by Robert Allot to purchasers who already owned the 1616 Workes; \nwhereas, the (b) copies which are separately bound but preceded by the 1640 general- \ntitle are probably part of a remainder stock which Richard Meighen apparently acquired \nfrom Allot\u2019s heirs about the time Crooke obtained the copyrights to two of these 1631 \nplayst{s. The general-title was probably added by Meighen when Walkley\u2019s third \nvolume was advertised in the trade, though it is not unlikely that he sold some copies \nbefore adding the general-title. \nCopies (c) of parts II-1V (Walkley's third volume) separately bound without any \ngeneral-title are very uncommon but whether because they have been considered \nincomplete and so discarded, or because comparatively few copies were so issued cannot \nbe determined. According to Walkley\u2019s testimony this was the condition, \u2018printed and \nready for to be published\u2019, of his edition of Jonson\u2019s works when it was attached by \nParker. It is not unlikely that the reason no prefatory matter had been prepared was \nthat Digby, though overwhelmed with his intrigues and other affairs of state (see \nD.N.B. XV, 62), had kept Walkley in daily expectation. \nSince lawsuits in the seventeenth century were even more interminable affairs than \nthey are today, though the actual records are not available, Walkley probably was \ndeprived of his property for some time; at any rate, Dr. Greg has observed\u00a7\u00e9 that the \n\n  \n\n   \n\n{eDr. Greg\u2019s copy of this is bound with combination \u2018c\u2019 which may merely be the result of sophistication. \n$oThese complete copies frequently occur with Part III, containing the 1649 plays, bound immediately after \nthe 1631 plays so that all the plays are together. The order of the 163 plays is also frequently that given \non the general-title rather than the order in which according to their collation they were intended to be \nissued, These variations, however, may be entirely due to the initiative of the binders either early or late. \n$oThere is no evidence to prove this assertion except that otherwise there is no apparent explanation for \nMeighen\u2019s connection with these plays for if the remainder stock had also been acquired by Crooke he \nwould presumably have retailed it himself. Dr. Greg (Trans. XI (1931) 464) has suggested that perhaps \nMeighen was associated with Walkley in this enterprise but that is not likely since Walkley's volume was \nintended to have a separate title and preliminaries. \n\u00a7Masques p.xviii., \n\nVOL. [ 579 1\n\nrecto Sig Br of Part II is soiled in many copies as though the folded sheets had lain \nfor some period unprotected in a warehouse. Eventually, however, Walkley must \nhave obtained some sort of settlement which, though it may have forced him to share \nsome of the stock with Crooke and Benson, left him in possession of the copyrightfc \nto the works he had printed. Probably in June 1640, when Crooke attemptedic to \nregister The Divell is an Asse, Walkley discovered that that play had never been entered \nin the Stationers\u2019 Register and that Crooke did not have the copyright to it although \nhe did own the rights to the two other plays printed in 1631. Apparently Walkley was \nable to prevent Crooke from acquiring a clear title to the play for in 1641 Walkley \nhired Thomas Harper to reprint that play for him, and issued some copies (c) with \nhis parts II-IVf{c and included the title in his belated entry in 1658. \nIt is difficult to explain the reason for the substitution of the 1641 reprint of Divell \nis an Asse in some complete copies (e) for it is unlikely that the sheets of the 1631 \nedition of that play gave out before the others\u00a7\u00a2 since it was printed with signatures \nand pagination continuing those of Bartholomew Fayre. On the other hand, this com- \nbination cannot always have been the result of late sophistication because the Digby \npresentation copy in contemporary morocco, described by Dobell, is an example. \nFrom the fact that Walkley never prepared a general-title for his third volume it \nmay perhaps be inferred that either he was deprived in the settlement of the lawsuit of \na large portion of his stock or, in his disgust with the whole business, he sold most of \nthe copies wholesale, possibly to Meighenfd or even to Crooke. Consequently, the \nordinary complete copies (d), which certainly are the most common form in the hands \nof collectors today, may never have been bought retail from Walkley. \n\u2018There are large-paper copies of the 1631 plays. One, with blank [A], is the W.A.Clark \n(Huth-Chew copy) and one, with the general-title, is the Huntington (Griswold-Hoe). \n\n[Vonume III, Part I: Masques, Under-woods, Mortimer] \nCoutation: B-Q*; R?; S-X*; \u00a5?; Z-Oo#; Pp?; Qq4; 146 leaves.

The device on the title may have been the property of Seile \ninstead of Elizabeth Purslowe for it was used in 1636 on the title of Heylyn\u2019s History \nof the Sabbath which Thomas Harper printed for Seile. \nAccording to the Britwell Catalogue 1922, Lot 399, copies show slight variations, for \nexample the Elegie ending on recto d3 in some copies, e.g. the present, is signed \n\u201cW.ABINGTON\u2019; in others it is unsigned. Also the Elegie ending on recto F is signed \n\nVOL.IT [ 583 ]\n\n\u2018].MAYNE\u2019 in some copies, e.g. the present, but is unsigned in others. The sheets of \ncourse were gathered without regard to state. \nJonson died on 6th August 1637. \u201cThree days later he was followed from his house \nin Westminster to his grave in the Abbey by a throng which included \u2018all or the greatest \npart of the nobilitie and gentry then in the town\u2019. Neglected as his later days had been, \nthe passing of Ben was, for the entire English world of letters, the passing of its king\u2014a \nking who had perhaps ceased to govern, but who still reigned.\u201d The honor of such a \nfuneral was not the only testimony to his memory for, shortly after, preparations were \nset on foot for a volume of memorial poems. Brian Duppa, then Dean of Christ Church, \nacted as editorf. Through lack of organization or perhaps for the more generous reason \nalleged by the printer in his note prefixed to this volume its publication was delayed. \nBy the 23 January 1638, however, it was in such shape that it was licensed for printing, \nand finally, 3 February 1638, it was entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register and was pre- \nsumably published shortly thereafter. \nThe thirty-three pieces which make up this slender volume include contributions \nfrom most of the more cavalier of the poets of the time. Elegiac collections such as this \nwere common enough in the seventeenth century but Henry King, one of the con- \ntributors to the present admits: \n\u2018At common graves we have Poetick eyes \nCan melt themselves in easie Elegies; \nEach quill can drop his tributary verse, \nAnd join it, like the Hatchments, to the Herse: \nNevertheless, although perhaps some of the greatest of the poets then living were \nstrangely omitted from the list of contributors, this volume has little of the formalism \nand insincerity of the usual \u00e9loge and, though only in places it shows much poetic force \nor felicity, has throughout a hearty feeling which testifies to the radiating and mastering \nforce of Jonson's personality. \nMiss Bartlett has listed the Shakespeare allusions to be found in this book, Mr. William \nShakespeare No.310. \n\n{Preserved in the Harleian MS. (4153,6.21) is a letter from Sir Kenelm Digby to Duppa in which Digby \nurges Duppa to issue this book. See also a letter to Duppa by Howell (Jacobs's Howell's Familiar Leters \n1-332) and a poem \u201cTo Doctor Duppa\u2019 by Davenant (Madagascar (1638) 138-141). \ntHaclite 1, 240 gives a list of the contributors which ought to be supplemented by a note regarding the \nanonymous poem on recto E2 which John Drinkwater has shown (\u00a5.L.8. 25 Oct.1923) was probably by \nSidney Godolphin. The poem on recto [Ky] is signed T.Terrent, but ascribed in Hazlite to J.Tennant. \n\u2018The verses by Waller are his first appearance in print. According to Aubrey (Edit. Clark 1, 11) it was \nLucius Carey, Viscount Falkland who gave the name \u2018virbius\u2019 to this collection. \n\nS.T.C. 14784, ARBERIV. 407. Hazurrr I, 240. Asutey Car. II], 8. W.A.

Who was so farre from consenting to the printing of his \nBook at that time, that he had not then Corrected those parts of it, which he was \nfore\u2019d to passe over with lesse care, by reason of the hasty calling of it out of his hands, \nby the Entertainment for which it was design'd. So that (I may say) the former Im- \npression is no better than a Corrupted Fragment, or Foul Draught, of what this Play \nwas intended, and differing so much from what it now is, that if the Corrections, \nExpungings, and Additions, be consider\u2019d, it is almost the one half otherwise.

The entry lists them in \nthe same order in which they are here printed and may have been made from a copy \nalready set-up. However, before such copies were issued Herringman apparently made \narrangements with Crooke, who had entered Claricilla and The Prisoners in 1640 and \npublished them in 1641, that enabled Herringman to append copies of those plays to \nhis edition, thereby making a complete collection of Killigrew's plays. \nIt is possible that Crooke issued copies of this edition of his two plays separately, \nbut we have not seen any. However, as copies with Crooke\u2019s imprint in the last two \nplays are, apparently, much rarer than those with Herringman\u2019s imprint throughout, \nit is probable that such copies were originally issued by Crooke as his share in the \nedition. \nThere are large-paper copies of this volume. \n\nAnper IV. 504, 517.

G. f. 3) is the only example knownt. \n\nIt is from an entirely different setting\u2014the extent of the variations can be sampled \n\nin the title, see cut. Despite their difference in format, one edition is a paginary re- \n\n\u2018The variant readings given by Nichols in his Progresses indicate that another copy was then in the pos- \nsession of the Duchess of Portland, She was Margaret Cavendish Harley, only child and heir of Edward \nHarley, and Earl of Oxford, the collector of the Harleian Library. Her eldest daughter was the wife of the \n\nist Marquis of Bath. Therefore, it is not unlikely, if one may judge from analogous cases, that that copy \nis now at Longleat. \n\n[ 598 ]\n\nprint of the other, but, although there are numerous variations in orthography there \ndoes not appear to be very much evidence by which their relative order may be de- \ntermined. The following readings appear to be material: in the first page of text, line \n13, of the \u2018Burton\u2019 edition \u2018any where\u2019 is spelled \u2018ony whear\u2019 but in the present that \nreading is corrupted to \u2018only whear\u2019. Page 5, line 23, the duration of the fourth King- \ndom of the Saxons is in the Burton said to be 249 years which from the dates there \ngiven is obviously wrong; as originally set-up, the present edition repeated that error \nbut upon being noticed the entire fifth page was reset and corrected to \u2018259\u2019t. Page 7, \nin the Burton, Ichington is said to be three miles from Warwick, while in the present \nthe distance is correctly given as seven miles. \nFrom these variants it would appear that the Burton edition preceded the present. \nOn the other hand it may be noted, p.4s, that Wednock Park is said in the Burton to \nbe a \u2018goodly park of the right honorable, my very good Lord the earl of warwyk\u2019, \nwhich is correct\u2014the estate being still in the hands of his descendants. In the present \nthat park is described as a \u2018goodly park of the Queenz Maieftyec\u2019 which can only be \nexplained as a gratuitous emendation. \nBoth editions were anonymously printed. The only clue to the printers is the pres- \nence in the Burton edition of an ornamental initial \u2018A\u2019 which belonged to John Charle- \nwood; in the present, of a factotum, reproduced Trans. III (192) 208, No.31, which \nisa stock pattern used by numerous printers, The factotum used in the present appears \nto be similar, if not identical, to one used by Abel Jeffes. \nThe lavish entertainment provided by the Earl of Leicester for the Queen during \nher visit to Kenilworth from the gth to 27th July 1575 inclusive is of more than usual \ninterest for it is thought, perhaps only by the more sentimental biographers, that the \nyoung Shakespeare was brought over from Stratford by his father whose interest in \ndrama is well known, and that in the Tempest there is a faint echo of a childhood \nmemory of the pageantry on the lake. In any case, this report of the entertainment is \nof considerable value as it gives the viewpoint of the spectators, Lancham was the \nKeeper of the Council Chamber Door, rather than of the playwrights, and since Lane- \nham was a quaint gossip who loved to talk about himself or anything else which came \nto mind it is entertaining as wellf}. \nThis work is written in the form of a letter to Master Humphrey Martin, a London \nMercer, and is signed \u2018Par me R.L. Gent. Mercer\u2019, and dated \u2018At the Citee of Worceter, \nthe xx of Auguft. 1575\u2019. It has always been accepted that the initials stood for those of \nRobert Laneham for the author on p.44 states \u2018while my name iz Laneham\u2019 and on \np-84 referring to himself says \u2018anoother good Langham\u2019. The curious spelling used \n\ntt may be noted that in line 22 of this same page the Burton edition reads \u2018Horfus\u2019 (for Horsa) while the \nfirst state of the present edition reads \u2018Horfins\u2019 and the second \u2018Horfius'\u2014this appears to indicate pro- \ngressively a corruption and then a correction. \nH#There is another account of this visit in Gascoigne\u2019s Princelye pleasures, at the Courte at Kenelwoorth 1576\u2014 \nthe unique Wright-Farmer-EBllis-Park-Hill-Staunton copy of this was burned in the Shakespeare Library \nfire at Manchester\u2014which is preserved in the Workes 1587 [q.v-], and also in the 1821 reprint. Gascoigne\u2019s \naccount, in a large measure, supplements Lancham\u2019s but in some points they contradict each other. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nVOLT [ 599 ]\n\nthroughout this work has caused more than one commentator to refer to it as having \nbeen written in Warwickshire dialect, and, though that is most unlikely for Laneham \nclaims to be from Nottinghamshire and to have travelled abroad, there is something \nabout this whole piece which makes it sound like the jew d'esprit of a more practised \nhand than that of a Mercer. \nBibliographically the most interesting feature of this piece is the list of popular \nbooks which Laneham says he saw in Captain Cox\u2019s library (pp.34-7)- Many of the \nworks there listed are not extant in editions of so early a date. Cox, or rather his ghost, \nwas introduced in Jonson\u2019s Kenilworth Mask of Owls of 1626. \nOf this present edition nine other copies, besides a fragment, can be traced. Two, \n\u2018one of each state, are in the Bodleian, another is in the British Museum (George III), \nand others at St. John\u2019s and Emmanuel Colleges Cambridge, Huntington (Huth), \nChapin (Bridgewater-Huntington-Jones), and Folger (Blandford-Freeling-Corser- \nHalliwell) Libraries. A large, though made-up copy is now at Quaritch where also is a \nfragment. \n\nS.T.C. 15191. Huntivcron C.L,, 248. Hurn Car. II, 816, W.A. Ware Car., 77.",

So that all due care hath been taken that \nthis Translation might have it\u2019s utmost Perfection, and the Author now appears in Eng- \nlish more full, and with greater Advantage than any Edition of his, that ever I yet saw \nin the Original Language\u2019. \nSaintsbury said of this work: \u2018To the literary critic no less than to the man of the \nworld La Rochefoucauld ranks among the scanty number of pocket-books to be read \nand re-read with ever new admiration, instruction and delight\u2019. \n\n} These editions cannot be identified. No edition of 1691 is recorded by Tchemerzine or in the catalogue of \n\nthe Bibliotheque Nationale. There is a Lyons edition of 1690 and Paris editions of 1692 and 1693, how- \n\never, which conform to the descriptions here given. \nflt has been variously attributed to Jacques Esprit, Comberville, Henri de Ia Chapelle Bessay, and Chev- \neau and was suppressed in the editions after 1665 until reprinted in the Paris editions of 1692 and 1693 \n\nnoted above.",

A variant of that, e.g. two copies in the British Museum (C.53.a.11 \nand G.11844), has sheets A-E and T-Aa, as well as Dd-Ee (except for alterations made \nwhile the type was standing) identical with the first edition; sheets R and Bb are \nidentical with those found in the present edition; the remaining sheets, F-Q, S, and \nCo, are from settings distinct from either the first or the present editiont. \nAn examination of the present edition shows that, with the exception of two sheets, \nR and Bb, which are from the setting used in the variant first edition, it is quite dis- \n\n}To Mr.F.S.Ferguson is due most of the following information regarding variant British Museum copies. \nThe edition listed as $.T.C, No.15275 is a ghost.

Not many editiones principes are as completely satisfactory as \nthis one for it has an air and style quite its own. It may be that our judgment has been \ninfluenced by the condition of this copy which, despite the missing leaves and partly \nperhaps because of the red printing (fol.253) and the rubrication, seems worthy of its \nprimacy, see Plate No.XXV. \nThis romance, though the title, characters and setting are classical, is in reality far \nremoved from Homer's Troy, or even from Renaissance antiquarianism. The temper \nand characters are medieval Burgundian, and in their way, as Caxton retells Le Fevre\u2019s \nstories, quite refreshing. \nSeventeen copies can be traced of which complete ones are: the Morgan (Jersey- \nAmherst), British Museum (Harleian-West-George III), and Marquess of Bath. Imper- \nfect copies are the University Library Cambridge (two, both Bishop Moore), Trinity \nCollege Cambridge, Bodleian (Bowen; Selden), Bibliotheque Nationale (Steevens- \nSpencer-Edwards-Inglis), Sion College, College of Physicians (London), Rylands \n(Tutet-Austen-Spencer), Huntington (Roxburghe-Devonshire), Morgan (Lloyd-Hib- \nbert-Wilkes-Utterson-Ashburnham-Bennett), Fenwick (Mainwaring-Phillipps), the de- \nscendents of Beriah Botfield, and the present.

X, 1929, pp-1-42). \nAlthough the contents of this edition are treated as a \u2018linked\u2019 book, the three parts \nwere not originally so printed. Their format indicates separate publication. The two \nlater parts are sometimes found bound after copies of Scot\u2019s first edition of the Dialog, \nprinted about 1554. Hamer (op. /aud.) suggests that Scot reprinted, about 1558-9, the \nTragedie of the Cardinal intending to add it (the signatures follow) to such copies of \nthat edition of the Dialog as remained unsold. Shortly thereafter, however, he came \nacross copies of the two Paris [Rouen] editions of 1558 which, as they contained reprints \nof the minor poems not included in his edition of the Dialog, induced him to print \u2018The \nTestament of Papyngo\u2019 with the \u2018Dreme\u2019 and the \u2018Complaynt of Lyndesay\u2019 appending \nthereto a condemnation of the errors and misprints of the Paris [Rouen] editions. This \ncollection he also sold with his edition of the Dialog for there are copies so combined, \ne.g. the British Museum and Edinburgh University. Afterwards, when the remainder \nof his first edition of the Dialog was exhausted he made the present paginary reprint, \nrepeating on the title his warning against the Paris [Rouen] editions and sold it com- \nbined with the two parts containing the minor poems as before. \nOF copies in the present state only two others can be traced\u2014the Bodleian and the \nLambeth.

The Constitutions, however, had been previ- \nously printed. \nDes Maiseaux belonged to that interesting group of erudite French Protestants of \nthe early eighteenth century who were familiar friends of the learned both in England \nand on the Continent. He was assisted and encouraged in his work by Anthony Collins, \nthe disciple and correspondent of Locke\u2019s later years.",

The \nmanuscript of an earlier essay on the same subject written in Latin was exhibited in \nthe Tercentenary Exhibition of Bumpus in 1932. \n\u2018The importance of few philosophical books have been so quickly recognized as was \nthe case with the present. It passed through many editions in English and has several \ntimes been translated. \n\nfit is said that in some copies the dedication is dated \u2018Dorset Court, May 24, 1689\".

Moly- \nneux\u2019s interest in the Essay did not flag. The 23rd December 1693, he wrote Locke \n(MS.73): \u2018I have now read over your Essay of Humane Understanding a third time; \nand always make New discoverys therein of fomething Profound. I fhould fete upon \nit again, but that I'll wait for your Next Edition; which I hope by this time is almost \nfinished\u2019. \nThe second edition was not ready as soon as was expected for it was not until 28th \nJuly 1694 (MS.76) that Molyneux wrote: \u2018My most Honour\u2019d Friend For fo you have \npublickly allowed me to callf you; and tis a Title wherein I boast more than in Maces \nor Parliament-Robes. By this you may find I have received the 24 Edition of your \nEssay, which I prize as an Inestimable Treasure of Knowledge. tis [sic] but a Week \nfince it came to me; and I have yet only lookd over those Parts which are newly added, \nparticularly that of Liberty, the alterations wherein I take to be most Judiciously \nmade... In time I fhall give you my farther Thoughts of \u00a7 other Parts of your \nBook; where any thing Occurs to mef{. But at present I can only Pour out my thanks \nto you for the Favourable Character under which you have transmitted me to posterity \n\n   \n\nThere is in this collection tangible evidence concerning this friendship in the form of a complete series of \nMolyneux\u2019s letters to Locke (34 letters from William Molyneux, see MSS. 63-103 passim). \nA footnote at that point reads: \u2018See MT Lockes Effay of H.U. 24 Edit.p.68\u2019. The reference occurs at the \nbottom of p.67 and top of p.68: \u2018To which purpofe I fhall here infert a Problem of that very Ingenious and \nStudious promoter of real Knowledge the Learned and Worthy Mr. Molineux, which he was pleafed t0 \nfend me in a Letter [MS.68] some Months fince; . . . I agree with this thinking Gent. whom though 1 \nhave never had the happinefs to fee, Iam proud to call my Friend...\u2019 \n{41e was not until the rth January 1695 (MS.78) that Molyneux fulfilled this promise, In his letter of that \n\ndate he listed twenty \u2018Errata\u2019, mostly literal or typographical. Curiously, he did not make those corrections \nin this copy. \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n[ 622 J\n\npag 67. My Only Concern is that I can pretend to None of it, but that of your Friend; \nand this I fett up for in the highest degree. I fhould think my felf Happy, had I but \nhalf the Title to the Rest .. . . \nMolyneux in his letter of 2nd March 1693 (MS.68) suggested \u2018that I fhould think \nit Convenient in your Next Edition, to Expres the Abstract or Content of each Section \nin the Margin, and to Spare (if you think fit) the Table of Contents at y\u00a2 Latter end \nof the Book, tho I think both may do best . . . \u2019. It must have pleased him to note \nwhen he received this copy that Locke had followed his suggestions. \nRegarding the separate printing of the added passages in this edition see preceding \nnumber. \n\nArper VC. 11. 541.",

With the exception of one visit which Moly- \nneux made in 1698, their intercourse was entirely by correspondence and the whole \nof that correspondence which Locke received is here preserved together with several of \nthe letters of William\u2019s younger brother, Thomas (1661-1733), whom Locke had met \nearlier in Holland. The first letter, 27th August 1692, was written in reply to one by \nLocke expressing pleasure at the commendation of his Essay on the Human Under- \nstanding which Molyneux had included in the Dedicatory Epistle to his Dioptrica Nova \n1692; and the last, 26th November 1698, is an acknowledgment by Thomas Molyneux \nof Locke\u2019s consolatory letter (printed in Dudlin University Magazine XVIII, 1841, 751) \non the death of his brother. \nThese letters, together with the corresponding replies of Locke, were printedta in \n1708 in a collection, Some familiar letters between Mr. Locke and several of his friends \n{q-v.], which was reprinted in Locke\u2019s Works III, 1714, and succeeding editions. They \nare of considerable interest to students of the development of Locke\u2019s philosophical \nworks but they also contain interesting comments on Sir Richard Blackmore, Leibnitz, \nLe Clerc, and others. \u2018The story of the Latin translation of Locke\u2019s Essay on Human \nUnderstanding, which William Molyneux undertook to have done first by a Mr. Mul- \nlart and later by a Mr. Burridge, is set forth with considerable detail. See also No.6o1. \nThese letters were formerly in the Alfred Morrison collection (IV, 1919, Lot 2943). \nFollowing a roughly chronological order, they are tipped-in a large folio volume (15 x \n114 inches), bound uniformly with the volume [q.v.] containing the letters of Locke to \nAnthony Collins, green morocco by Goupil. The forty letters of William and Thomas \nMolyneux are numbered twice in an early hand. One series is in red ink and runs, with- \nout any particular chronological order from 1 to 42 with the omission of numbers 6, \n8, 19, 28-30, and the repetition of numbers 3, 11, 27, and 34. The other series, which \napparently once included Locke's part of this correspondence, is in strictly chrono- \nlogical order except that the letters of Thomas Molyneux are placed at the end. In the \nfollowing list these numbers are recorded, the ones in red ink first and the others second. \n\ntaThe printer's marks may still be seen, Numerous passages, none of any moment, mostly personal or \npolite expressions, were deleted. \n\nVoL.

The Margarite was not written in \n1596 but several years before when the author was in the Straits of Magellan with \nCavendish and, though the other three pieces may have been written at the time of \ntheir publication, there is no evidence to prove it. This burst of production in Lodge\u2019s \nlast year as a professional writer suggests that he handed over such manuscripts as he \nhad to the printer. Certainly, with the exception noted above, they are usually dis- \nmissed as \u2018hack-work\u2019 because they are in an entirely different vein from the rest of \nLodge\u2019s work. This opinion was not held by the author himself for he says of the present \nthat it is \u2018the real wheat of his brain\u2019 whereas his former poems and romances were \n\u201cmere corncockles\u2019. However, it has recently been pointed out (Alice Walker, R.E.S. \nVILL, 1932, 270-1) that much of the material for this book was not original with Lodge \nbut \u2018conveyed\u2019 by him from sources some of which are identified, e.g. it appears that \nAnthony's discourse on devils and magic is a mere translation of passages from the \nthird and fourth section of the first part of Joseph Angles\u2019s Mores Theologicarum; while \nthe closing pages are translated, again without acknowledgment, from the Lider con- \nsolationis of Albertanus of Brescia. \n\u2018At the end of this work the author promises if \u2018this daies discourse delight you\u2019 to \nwrite a continuation, but, as in the case of his Rosalynde, no such sequel was published \nor, at least, has survived. \nOf this book seven copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum (George IIT), \nBodleian (Malone), Trinity College Cambridge (Capell), Huntington (Farmer-Chal- \nmers-Britwell duplicate-Huth), Harvard (?Young-White), Folger (Hnglis), and the \npresent. \n\n  \n\n   \n\n\u2018Anes (Edit.

It also \neffectively demonstrated that classical satire is most suitably written in the decasyllabic \ncouplet while at the same time it made current the fashion of pseudonymous allusion. \nFor these reasons 4 fig for Momus ranks as one of the most important of Lodge\u2019s pro- \nductions. \n\u2018The present is likewise one of the rarest of Lodge\u2019s published works, for, besides the \npresent, only five copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum (Corser), Bodleian, \nHuntington (Hoe), Harvard (White), and the Folger (Clawson). \n\n{The books at Lamport which were not relegated to the lumber-room in the eighteenth century had a \nChippendale armorial bookplate from which this label was designed, cf. the Harmsworth copy of The \nCL Psalmes of David Middleburgh, 1602, and Linschoten Discours 1598, now at L.C.Harper's. \nPerhaps, also, the formal satire was practised by Donne and Bishop Hall before this date, but even if 0, \nthe honor of first printing still belongs to Lodge. \n\nS.T.C. 16658.

Quarto, \nCoutation: A(the first, probably blank, lacking)-I*; 35 leaves present, \nContents: title, recto [Aa]; verso blank; text, recto Ag-verso [I4]- \nRed morocco, Janseniste, by Riviere. 734 x 534 inches. The Mostyn (1919, Lot 190) copy. \n\nNo one has succeeded in distinguishing in this morality, for it is that though a late \nsurvival, between the work of Lodge and that of Greene. Also, though no one seems to \nhave attempted it, it would probably be difficult to justify on the grounds of com- \nparative value, the publication of five editions of this play. However, of three (viz. \nthe first, third, and fourth) only one copy of each is known while of the second edition \nfour copies can be traced, all in public collections. The present edition therefore is the \nonly one not absolutely unobtainable, and of it only eleven copies can be located. \nIt is not quite clear in what capacity Alsop was acting in the printing and sale of this \nbook. According to the Stationers\u2019 Register, Thomas Pavier in 1617 still owned the \ncopyright having obtained his rights by transfer, 14 August 1600, from Thomas Creede \nwho had made the original entry, 5 March 1594. But after Pavier's death when his \nwidow transferred his copyrights, 4 August 1626, this title was no longer apparently \npart of his estate. Furthermore, though Creede sold his rights to Pavier in 1600, two \nyears later when Pavier published his edition Creede printed it for him. It is therefore \nnot entirely strange that Alsop should be connected with this book for he had been in \npartnership with Creede and succeeded to the shop and furniture and pethaps also to \nthe copyrights, or some of them, upon Creede\u2019s death. \n\n   \n\nAn unique copy, lacking the title page but containing numerous annotations indicating its use as a prompt \ncopy, of what from internal evidence appears to be the fourth edition of this play printed c.1606 isin the \nChicago University Library and has been described by C.R.Baskervill, Modern Philology xox (1932) \n129-51. Te was formerly in the George Smith (2797, Lot 1174)-Heber (II, Lot 3471)-J- Fitchett Marsh- \nLocker (4 March 1920, Lot 292) libraries and was sold again in New Orleans, June 1930. \n\n  \n\nS.7.C. 16682.

Nothing is \nknown of an earlier provenance except that the person who sold this book in 1go1 had paid only \nsix shillings for it. \n\nIy many ways this book is the most important which Lodge wrote, as it was certainly \nthe most populart. It is, in its own right, an important example of the Elizabethan \npastoral novel, ranking with the Arcadia in intrinsic interest and not improbably excel- \nling it in style and mastery of that form. Nevertheless, it is now chiefly remembered \nbecause in it Shakespeare found \u2018practically the perfect outline and groundwork of \nAs You Like It\u2019. \nAlthough Rosalynde has been reprinted several times in recent years the text has \nalways been taken from the only other copy known of this edition which has the text of \nsheet R supplied from the second, 1592, editiont. \nNicholas Ling entered for this book in partnership with Busby but, though he con- \n\n{Though there were numerous editions published during the half-century following the appearance of the \npresent, all are extraordinarily rare.

Of the second, 1592, there are two \ncopies in the Bodleian (both Malone), and another, the Huth Bequest, in the British Museum. The third \nedition, 1596, is represented only by the Lamport Hall (1904, Lot 212)-Perry-Huntington copys the \nfourth, 1598, by two copies, the Huntington (Arbury) and Folger (Ouvry-Locker); the fifth, 16a, is \nknown only from the Walpole-Britwell-Huntington copy; and the sixth, 1609, is represented by copies \nin the British Museum and the Bodleian (Tanner); and the seventh, 1612, by copies in the British Muse \num, Capell, Folger, and Morgan Libraries. The eighth edition, 1614, is known only by the unique British \nMuseum (bought 1862) copy; while of the ninth, 1623, there are copies in the Capell, Dyce, Folger, \nHarmsworth, and Huntington Libraries.

Moreover, a comparison of the signa- \nture-positions shows that these sheets are throughout identical with those of the 1634 \nedition in the British Museum and distinctly different from the Corser copy of the \n1642 edition also in that library. There are no signs whatever that the title-leaf has been \ntampered with or that the sheet of which it is a part was inserted from another copy. \n\nHorn Car, III, 859.

With the exception of the resetting of these lines with \u2018Metamorphofis\u2019 properly \nemphasized in Great Primer, see Plate No.XXX, and the date changed to \u20181590\u2019, the \ntitle of the second issue is from the same setting as the first. Moreover, the alteration \nappears to have been made before the first sheet was entirely run-off for the second \nissue title is an integral part of sheet A. Thus from the title it is not possible to infer \nthat the sale of the book, from the start, was slow. Twenty years later, however, \nsufficient copies still remained to warrant a reissue with a cancel title which reads, \nquoting from the Rowfant Catalogue: A most pleasant Historie of Glaucus and Scilla. \nWith many excellent Poems, and delectable Sonnets. Imprinted at London. 1610. \nIt has been stated that the dedication, half-sheet signed \u2018\u2019, was not originally issued \nwith this book. Suffice it to say that it is found in at least one copy of each of the three \nissues. \nLodge's work in retrospect is frequently of great interest because it was experimental \nand was the means of introducing into English literature new forms or types. The \neponymous piece is an example, for it is the first romantic poem on a classical theme in \nEnglish, a type which was to become enormously popular being followed by Daniel, \nDrayton, Marlowe, Middleton and Nashe, and to reach its fullest flower in Venus and \nAdonis and Lucrece. In fact, the relationship of this poem to Venus and Adonist would \nbe sufficient to make this book an important addition to any library of Elizabethan \nliterature quite aside from either its intrinsic merit or its rarity. \nNevertheless, it is a very uncommon book for of the 1589 issue only four copies are \nknown, viz. the Bodleian (Malone), Dyce (Caldecott), Folger (Tho. Fuller\u2019s copy) and \nthe Huntington (Lamport-Britwell); of this 1590 issue the present is the only copy \nknown; and of the 1610, the Harvard (Farmer-Collier-Ouvry (Collier\u2019s nephew)- \nLocker-White) copy, likewise, appears to be unique. \n\nSee Paradise Thomas Lodge pp.83-4 and authorities there cited. \n\nS.7.C. 16674[a].

It is said that Shakespeare resented the omission of mention of \nhimself in the account in this book of the author\u2019s literary friends, p.s7, and quotes \nderisively from it in several of his plays. On p.62 is a reference which is doubtless to \nthe Ur-Hamlet. \n\u2018The present has been called the author\u2019s most effective non-narrative prose work, \nbut Alice Walker, though she admits (R.E.S.

The comparative popularity of the \ntwo parts as measured by the number of times they were printed gives circumstantial \nsupport to the contention of Professor J.D.Wilson that the England, though less \n\u2018euphuistic\u2019 than the Anatomy, by reason of the fact that it was addressed to \u2018the \nLadies\u2019 as well as the gentlemen of England, \u2018discovered a new literary public being \nrecognized then, as it is now, as far more readable and in every way . . . an improve- \nment upon its predecessor, the Anatomy\u2019. \n\u2018Though early editions of both parts are frequently bound together and may even \n\n{That list however should be amended as follows: No.17066 is another issue not of the 1623 edition but of \nan edition of 1630\u2014a copy of the second part is in the Bodleian Library (see Bond I, 105, and proof- \nsheets of S..C.).

Its popu- \nlarity may be gauged by the number of editions through which it passed and as to its \norigin and influence there is already an imposing mass of reading matter (see works of \nLandmann, Weymouth, Child, Bond, Wilson and Underhill). \n\nS.T.C. 17064.

The Holgate (1845) \u2014Britwell (1922, Lot \n450) copy with bookplate. \n\nTuere are three editions of this comedy dated 1584f and of these, according to the \nevidence presented below, the edition to which the copy here described belongs is the \nearliest. It has not been possible to confront these editions for no one library possesses \nthe three. However, Professor R.W.Bond (The Complete Works of \u00a5.L. 11 (1902) 302- \n360) has given a collation of the other two editions (no copy of the present edition \nhaving been available when his work was in progress), and so, by this indirect means \nthe data here set forth have been derived. \n\u2018These three editions have the same collation but may be easily distinguished by the \nreadings of their titles. In that edition which Bond believes to follow next after the \npresent but which we shall attempt to prove to be the third, the title reads: \u2018Campaspe, | \nPlayed beefore the | Queenes Maicstie on | newyeares day at night, by her | Maiesties \nChildren, and the | Children of Paules. | { Imprinted at London | for Thomas Cadman, | \n1584. |\u2019. Of that edition the only known copy is the Dyce. In the other edition, of which \ncopies are the British Museum (Garrick) and Bodleian (Malone), the title reads as in \nthe Dyce except that the fourth, fifth and sixth lines read: \u2018. . . by | fer Maiesties \nChildr\u00e9, and | the . . .\u2019. That these variant titles represent distinct editions and not \nmerely variant issues seems to be established by the fact that none of the signature \npositions of the present coincide with those of the other two editions (op. cit. p.304) \nexcept for the position of the signature on recto E which appears to be the same in \nboth the present and the Dyce edition, That sheet, however, is not from the same \nsetting in both these-editions by reason of the variant readings of its text which cannot \nwell be explained as alterations made while in the press. \n\u2018The evidence regarding the relationship of these editions is, for the most part, \n\n  \n\n{This volume was apparently printed by Thomas Dawson. \n{There seems to be no reason for suspecting that all three of the 1384 editions were not printed in that year \nfor it should be remembered that this was the first of Lyly\u2019s comedies and introduced a new style and \nantic drama which was exceedingly popular being copied by Shakespeare in his earliest \n\n  \n\nVOL. [ 655 ]\n\ninternal. Chambers conjectured that the present edition is the earliest, partly because \n\u2018a correction in the date of Court performance (cf. the three titles) is more likely to \nhave been made after one inaccuracy than after two; and partly because the abandoned \ntitle reference to Alexander is retained in the headline of the other two. It is possible \nto add to these arguments the evidence of the variant readings of the texts. The follow- \ning table of the more significant includes the fourth edition, printed 1591, which, as \nwill be apparent, was printed directly from the first editionft. \n\nFIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH \n(Present) (BM. and Bodl.)

In the second and third editions these readings have become progressively \ncorrupt, while in the 1591 which was printed directly from the first, these particular \nreadings were all restored to their original form except for the tenth which in that \nedition is correctly rendered for the first time. According to Bond, the British Museum \nedition was printed from the Dyce because it contains \u20182 bad corruptions\u2019, viz. Act I \nsc. i, 1.5 \u2018thurst\u2019 for \u2018thrust\u2019, and Act III sc. v, 1.28 \u2018pararamour\u2019 for \u2018paramour\u2019, which \nare not found in the other editions. Were this all the evidence which could be adduced \nregarding this point one would be inclined to accept his conclusion. But an examination \nof the table given above shows that if the B.M. edition was printed from the Dyce then \nthe first, second, fourth, seventh, and eighth readings must have been corrected either \nby a comparison with the first edition or by a rather astute or lucky proof-reader. \nMoreover, if one compares the variant readings of these editions in those instances \nwhere it is not so much a question of correctness of meaning as one of optional spellingta \nthere can be little doubt that the B.M. edition was printed from the first, and the Dyce \n\nHeThis accoiunts for the reversion to the date of Court performance used in the first edition but not for the \n\u2018omission of \u2018Alexander\u2019 and \u2018Diogenes\u2019 from the title. The only reasonable explanation of this circum- \nstance is that by 1591 this comedy had become known by the name of \u2018Campaspe\u2019, certainly later on it \nwas referred to by that name in the Stationers\u2019 Register, \n\u00a7The line-numbering is Bond\u2019s, \n\nta PRESENT B.M, and BODLEIAN DYCE \nAct Li, 1.65, Chyeronie Chyeronie Chyronie \nAct Vii, Lt Whats Whats Whatis \nAt ML ii, L. 38 ouertwhartes ouertwhartes ouerwhartes \nAct Wy, 14 yt y* that \n\n[ 656 |\n\nedition from the B.M. According to this hypothesis, Bond\u2019s \u2018bad corruptions\u2019 in the \nB.M. edition were so \u2018bad\u2019 that even the compositor of the Dyce edition detected them. \nCuriously enough, more copies of this first edition are known than of either of the \nother two although the various editors of this play, Reed excepted, have never been \nable to examine it. Five copies can now be traced, viz. the perfect copy at Dulwich \nCollege which somehow escaped Garrick, the Huntington (Huth), the Harvard (Locker- \nWhite), the J.K.Lilly (Bridgewater-Huntington-Jones-Clawson), and the present. \n\nS.T.C. 17048b.

A later issue of that edition \nhas Markham\u2019s name on a cancel title reading \u2018pleasant comedy\u2019. The Huntington \n(Heber-Devonshire) copy of that issue is unique. It has been surmised that the badly \nlinked underplot was added by Machin and that this tampering with Markham\u2019s play \nled to the withdrawal of his name from the title, but that is not tenable since the issue \nwith Markham\u2019s name is the later. \nJohn Bache who published the first edition of this play transferred his rights in it, \nalong with four other titles, to Robert Wilson, rgth November 1610. Of the rights \nwhich he thus acquired, Wilson apparently published under his own name only one, \nthe third and fourth editions of Johnson\u2019s Essayes. There is no record, however, of any \ntransfer of the copyright in this book from Wilson to Sheares. \nThe first edition of this play is a rare volume, the eight copies which we can trace \nbeing in public collections.

The present title was \nprobably chosen by the publishert on account of the popularity of two other books of \nthe same name, the property of other publishers, with which this little volume has \napparently no connection whatever except, perhaps, that in a very general way the \ntitle may be said to be appropriate to all of them. For a similar instance of appropriation \nofa title by another publisher see discussion of Wrednot\u2019s Palladis palatium 1604 under \nitem No,802. \n\u2018The title \u201cThe mothers blessing\u2019 was first used, apparently, by Nicholas Breton in \n1602 [q.v.]. That \u2018little tract of morall discipline\u2019 in rime-royal was republished in 1621 \nby John Smethwicke. An even more popular volume of the same name, written by \nDorothy Leigh, was entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register in 1616. Of it John Budge \npublished the seventh edition in 16214. Apparently, it also was in verse. \nConcerning the author of the present volume there is the direct evidence of the \ninitials in the title and preface and the statement of the Stationers\u2019 Register that this \nbook is by \u2018G.Markham\u2019. The only noticeable feature of the text, which otherwise \nappears to be rather ordinary, is the frequent use of the word \u2018vilde\u2019. \nThat it was the publisher's, not the authors, ttl is indicated by the evidence of the headlines. Regarding \nthis practise see note under No.1099. \nHLeigh\u2019s he mothers blessing appears to have gone t \night editions are recorded in the Short-Title Catalogue ( \nan edition in 1634 of which a copy is at Bexhill, and Laml \nin Censuria Literaria VI, 1815, p.121~ \n\nrough at least nineteen editions before 1641.

From the rarity of several of these \neditions it is possible that others were published which have not survived. All six \npurport, with probable untruth, to have been printed at Middleburgh in Holland. Two \nof the editionst are abridged and contain the Epigrams preceding the Elegies. Their \ntext is derived from a different manuscript than the present and the four editions of \nthe present series may be considered a different work. \nThe ist June 1599, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London directed \nthe Master and Wardens that \u2018Such bookes [of a list which includes \u201cDavyes Epigrams, \nwith Marlowes Elegyes\u2019] as can be found or are allready taken . . . lett them bee \npresentlye broughte to the Bishop of London [Bancroft] to be burnte\u2019 (Arber I11.677). \n\nBoth are known by a single example and are usually distinguished by their provenance as the \u2018Isham\u2019 \nand \u201cBindley\u2019 editions. The former is in the Huntington Library (Lamport-Britwell) and the latter ia \nthe British Museum (Bindley-Heber). Though both claim to have been printed at Middleburgh their \nsignatures are in Waldegrave\u2019s peculiar manner (cf. Alexander Tragedie of Darius 1603). It is difficult to \nbelieve that that Puritan printer, then the King\u2019s Printer in Edinburgh, would have been concerned in \nsuch a venture though similar, if not identical, types occur in books printed by him. Concerning the \n\nsimilarity of Waldegrave's work, but not his signatures, to that of Richard Schilders of Middleburgh, \nsee J.D.Wilson Trans. XI (1911) 65-134. \n\n[664 ]\n\n\u201cTheis bookes presently therevppon were burnte in the hall\u2019 (4 June 1599, Arber IIT. \n678). From the fact that the edition seized apparently contained the Epigrams before \nthe Elegies as in the Isham and Bindley editions it was probably one of them, or another \nedition like them, that was then condemnedf. \n\u2018The burning, however, merely establishes a date before which one or more editions \nwere in print. Davies's Epigrams were probably written by 1594, and as for Marlowe's \ntranslation, its metrical inexperience, juvenile poverty of expression, and meager \nscholarship seem to indicate a date of composition much earlier than 1593. There are \nseveral contemporary allusions to both the clegies and epigrams, one as early as 1594, \nbut the probability that those works were circulated in manuscript makes such refer- \nences of slight value as evidence of the date of printing. \nOf the four unabridged editions of the present series, two are obviously earlier than \nthe others for they collate: A-F\u00ae G+, and consequently, other things being equal, proba- \nbly precede the two editions which collate: A-F8. Of these last the present is presuma- \nbly the earlier}}. It may be distinguished from the other by the ornaments on the title \nwhich are as above in the present, and in the other consist of a block of four type- \nornaments. \n\u2018The present edition was probably printed about 1630 as in it lower-case i and j, u \nand v are employed according to modern usage but the printer had no upper-case J \nor U. The other edition\u00a7 which collates as does the present, may be ascribed to a period \nabout 1640 from the fact that in several instances it occurs in contemporary binding \nwith six other translations of Ovid of which the five dated ones are either 1639 ot 1640, \nviz. $.T.C. 18947, 189354, 4986, 18948, 18981 and 18938. In marketing these Michael \nSparke appears to have been the leader. \nThe second version of Elegy 15, Book I which is ascribed in the headline to \u2018B.I.\u201d \nmay, without much question, be attributed to Ben Jonson as it was afterwards inserted \nin his Poetaster 1602 [q.v.}. It rather blatantly displays a polish and ease quite lacking \nin Marlowe\u2019s version. \nUpon purely circumstantial grounds the Isham edition probably has a better claim to have been issued \n\nin 1599 than any other for that copy is still bound in wha appears to be contemporary vellum with two \nother books dated 1599. \ntthe Skort-Title Catalogue describes an edition (No.18932) reading \u2018Middelbourgh\u2019 in the imprint. No \ncopy of such an edition can be traced and it is doubtless a ghost. \n\u00a7From the ornament and type that edition was apparently printed by the London printer of one of the \nlater editions of Heywood\u2019s translation of Ovid's De arte amandi (S.7.C. 189352), probably Thomas Cotes. \n\nS.T.C, 18933.

When in Hibbert\u2019s collection (but \naccording to the sale catalogue not when in Farmer's) this volume contained a four-leaf rhyme \ncalled \u2018Mar-Martine\u2019t which was taken out when at Britwell Court and separately bound in \norder that it might be placed with the poetry which was separately shelved in that collection. \nTt was sold 1924, Lot 526. \n\nPRoFEssoR Bonn distinguishes three early editions of this work, all with the same \ncollation, and all undated (Lyly\u2019s Works III pp.388-92).

Their respective time of \nissue, however, cannot even be conjectured. \nOf all the anti-Martinist tracts written by the professional pamphleteers this is the \nonly one of which the authorship is not disputed. The reason for this is that it contains, \nverso B2, an attack upon Gabriel Harvey\u2019s Three Letters (q.v.] to which Harvey com- \nposed a long reply, which later he printed in his Supererogation [q.v.] in the course of \nwhich he identifies Lyly as the author of Pappe. \nOf the three editions of this work some twenty-two copies can be located.

Since that same \ndevice appears on the titles of the companion pieces, The returne of Pasquill (q.v.] and \nThe first parte of Pasquils Apologie, it has been suggested that that uniformity of format \nis further evidence that the present edition is the earlier, probably printed in August, \nwhile the second did not appear until October. \nDr. McKerrow has disposed of such evidence as was formerly thought to connect \n\u2018Thomas Nashe with the Pasquill tracts of this controversy so that, at present, they \nmust be considered strictly anonymous. \nOf the present state at least five other copies are known, viz, the Ashley copy, \nHarmsworth, Bemis, New York Public, and the Chapin (Ames-Herbert-Maskell- \nHuth) copy. Of the second edition there are copies in the British Museum, Bodleian, \nRylands, Huntington, and the Harvard (White) Libraries. \n\nS.T.C. 19456. Asuuey Car. II, 184.",

See Pappe with an hatchet, \n\nTHERE are two distinct settings of large portions of this tract. They do not appear to \nhave been gathered indiscriminately but occur in three distinct combinations which \nDr. McKerrow designates as A (present), B, and Cf. Copies may be identified by the \nreadings of line 31, recto B4, which in A reads \u2018she should\u2019, in B \u2018he should\u2019, and in C \n\u2018hee should\u2019. For a complete list of the variant readings see McKerrow\u2019s Nashe. \nSince there are never more than two settings of any one forme, and, apparently only \nthree combinations in which they occur (though why that should be the case is inex- \nplicable), the following table, showing the correspondence between the groups of these \nsettings, may be of some assistance. \n\nSheet A, outer forme: same in A and B, different in C (except for recto A which is the same in \nall three). \nSheet A, inner forme: same in A and B; different in C. \nSheet B, outer forme: same in A and C; different in B. \nSheet B, inner forme: same in A and B; different in C (except for versoB3 which is the same in \nall three). \nSheet C, both formes: same in all three except recto C which differs in B from A and C. \nSheet D, outer forme: same in A and C; different in B, \n\nSheet D, inner forme: same in A and C; different in B (except verso D3 and recto D4 which \nare the same in all three). \n\nAltogether we have located twenty other copies of the three combinations including \n\n\u2018tudging from rather inadequate evidence of \n\nr corrections in the text, the order of production of these com- \nbinations appears to be C> A> B. \n\n( 674 ]\n\ncopies all three settings at Lambeth. The Farmer-Huth} copy in the Chapin Library \nbelongs to B, while the Bemis (Herbert-Jones-Clawson) copy belongs to C. \nThis is the second of Pasquill\u2019s contributions to the Marprelate controversy. In the \nCountercuffe Pasquill is represented as going abroad to publish his \u2018Lives of the Saints\u2019 \nand in the present he is supposed to be again in London where he meets Marforius and \nengages in the dialogue which is this book. According to Dr. McKerrow, Marforio was \nthe name of an ancient statue that stood near the palazzo Braschi and which had been \nfound in the Forum of Mars (Martis foro). It was the custom to affix to it replies to \nthe libels on the Pasquill statue. \n\ntGrosart used the Huth copy in his edition of Nashe. That copy was not available when Dr. McKerrow \nwas preparing his edition. All of the twenty-odd variant readings noted by McKerrow as apparently to \nbe found in the Huth copy are due to Grosart\u2019s errors, \n\nS.T.C. 19457. Huntinoron C.L., 308.

But damnation on a politique religion.\u2019 the line \u2018I am wearie, would I were \none of the Dukes hounds now.\" was omitted. In the second, this was rectified by trans- \nferring the first line, recto Ba, of the first state \u2018Pietro. Of a religious pollicie.\u2019 to the \nfoot of verso B, thus making room for the insertion of the omitted clause on recto B2. \nThe third state has the 26th line, verso B, \u2018the Church.\u2019, cut out and the scene heading \nleaded. This was probably due to a desire on the part of the author or publisher to \navoid offending the ecclesiastical authorities. In the present copy and the Kemble- \nDevonshire-Huntington (second state) this line has been cut out. The excision was \npresumably effected in the printing office. In the present copy an early hand has \nsupplied \u2018y\u00ae Church.\u2019 above the deletion. The same hand made several other corrections \nin the text. \nA considerable portion of the setting used in the present edition was retained in the \n\nsecond [q-v.], unaltered or with only minor changes due to unlocking of the formes for \ndeliberate addition or correction. \n\n{Two compositors set-up this copy, the division occurring at the end of sheet E. \nThis leaf may have been signed as in the second edition, though no copy can be traced, for in the second \n\nedition the compositors followed this setting even to signing, as here, the fourth leaf through E only. \nSee Trans.

It is possible that some copies of the \npresent edition were actually seized and burned in accordance with these orders though \nprobably most, if not all, of this edition had been dispersed at that time. In the year of \nthe burning, two editions \u2018Corrected, with the addition of newe Satyres {really only \none)\u2019 were publishedf. It is more likely, therefore, that copies of the earlier of these two \n1599 editions were those ordered burned, for if both these editions were surreptitiously \nprinted after the burning it is unlikely that they would have called attention, either by \nthe date of their imprints or otherwise, to the fact that they were not identical with \nthe 1598 edition. \nLike all of the Elizabethan collections of satires and epigrams this volume is of con- \nsiderable interest to scholars (Munro Shakespeare Allusion-Book 1, 52-3). Like most of \nthem it is also exceedingly rare, in fact of the present edition only four other copies are \nknown, viz. the British Museum (Bright), Bodleian (Malone), Huntington (Bolland- \nCorser-Huth), and the Folger (Perry-Haslewood-Britwell). \n\nFRELBrettle Trans.

The Arbury (1920, Lot \n202)\u2014G.D.Smith (II, 1920, Lot 233) copy with Newdigate 1709 bookplate. \n\nIr has long been accepted that the general-title reading \u2018Tragedies and Comedies\u2019 \n(reproduced Church Cat. II, 640) was the earlier. Indeed, Sheares\u2019s dedication (which \ndoes not occur in copies having that title) would appear to support that contention for \nthere Sheares refers to the odium under which everything connected with the stage lay \nat that time, i.e. the very year in which Prynne\u2019s Histriomastix [q.v.] was publishedt. \nFrom this it was inferred that the \u201cTragedies and Comedies\u2019 title was cancelled in favor \nof the more innocuous one reading \u2018Workes\u2019. \nHowever, an examination of unsophisticated copies reveals that the present title is \nan integral part of the first half-sheet and that the \u201cTragedies and Comedies\u2019 title is \nacancel (cf, Greg R-E.S. I, 105). The volume was first issued with the present title and \ndedication, both mentioning Marston\u2019s name, and with his name or initials, repeated on \neach of the separate titles, and signed to the epistles prefixed to Sophonisha and \nParasitaster. \nWhen this edition came to the author's attention he was presumably much exercised \n\n}Sheares says of this volume which includes The Dutch Courtesan that it \u2018is free from all obscene speeches\u2019! \n\nVOL. [ 687 ]\n\nfor since taking orders in 1609 he had renounced all connection with the stage. It has \nbeen suggested (Brettle Trans. VIII, 1927, 339) that perhaps through his \u2018ancient \nfriend\u2019 Henry Walley, bookseller and at that time Clerk of the Stationers\u2019 Company, \nMarston was able to force Sheares to remove all trace of the author\u2019s name from copies \nremaining in his hands. This was effected by substituting the \u2018Tragedies and Comedies\u2019 \ntitle, cancelling the dedication and substituting new separate titles and epistles \n\nthroughout. \nThere also appear to be two settings of sheet N (Brettle op.cit.). In the earlier, of \nwhich the present is an example, the first line of recto N reads\u2018... bloud...', \n\nin the later\u2018... blood...\u2019 \nThe text of this collected edition is taken from the separately printed quartos, but \nwhether Sheares obtained permission from the holders of the copyrights cannot be \ndetermined. Presumably he did for otherwise there would probably have been some \naction against him which would be recorded in the Registerst. \n\nAs far as can be traced Thomas Lownes owned the copyright to Anfonio and Mellida, presumably also to \nAntonio's Revenge (Arber 1V.176). William Aspley, who still was alive in 1633, probably retained the \nrights to the Malcontent and perhaps he had acquired the rights to Sophonisba on the death of John \nHodgetts who had acquired them in 1613 (Arber ILI.s21), and to the Parasitaster on the death of William \nBarrett who had acquired them in 1617 (Arber I1I.603) as well as to What you will on Thomas Thorpe\u2019s \ndeath for he had been in some sort of partnership with all these men. In any case, the Insatiate Countess \nwhich is the only previously published play which Sheares did not include was evidently jealously guarded \nby the owners for in 16gr it passed from Thomas Archer to Hugh Perry (Arber IV.248), and from him \nto Henry Taunton in 1634 (Arber IV.327). \n\nS.T.C. 17471, Huntinoron C.L., 277, Hazurr I, 280.

This dedication is substantially the same \nas appears in the reprint of 1634, except for some alterations and omissions necessitated \nby the fact that it was changed from a dedication to an individual to an address to the \nreader. The reason for the deletion of these leaves is to be found not in the dedication \nbut in the Latin address (transcribed op. cit.) which laments the fact that Burbie \u2018has \nwatched his own profit rather than my wishes or the real advantage of the reader\u2019 and \nhad refused to include two tables. Perhaps Meres thought he might be able to speak \nhis mind in this way because Burbie knew no Latin}. The result, however, was that \nwhen Burbie learned what Meres had said of him, since his note appears on the verso of \nthe last of the leaves containing the dedication, the whole of the latter of course was \ninvolved in the destruction. \nSig B was cancelled because of the omission of several words in the second paragraph. \n\u2018The cancellans was printed on Sig [A8] which originally may have been a blank. It \nseems more likely that the omission was discovered before the preliminary sheet was \nset-up for a blank leaf in that position would be rather unusual. If not, sheet A would \nhave had to go through the press not the usual two but four times. \nThis volume is one of the most important of the books containing contemporary \nreferences to Shakespearetf. It has the first mention of the Sonnets, as well as the first \nlist of his plays which last is of great importance as providing external evidence of use \nin determining the dates of plays which were not yet in print. It is perhaps on account \nof its Shakespearean interest that it is often forgotten that this book has other claims \nto importance for, besides providing a fund of information regarding Elizabethan taste \nand knowledge of art and natural history, it alludes to several works which are not now \n\n}The discovery of a copy which retained the uncancelled leaves was announced by F.$.Ferguson in the \nF.L.S. 7 Jane 1928, p.430, That copy is now in the private library of Dr. Rosenbach while another set \nof those leaves found in an imperfect copy sold at Hodgson\u2019s, 26 May 1932, is in the possession of the \nRosenbach Company. \n}Compare Milton's more successful use of this device in his Poems 1645 [q.v.) \nThese references occur in the chapter headed: \u2018A Comparative discourse of our English Poets, with the \nGreeke, Latine, and Italian Poets\u2019. See Munro Shakespeare Allusion-Book 1, 46-49. \n\n[704 ]\n\nknown to have been printed in English at that time. To take but one example, Gargantua \nis included in a list of twenty-four books \u2018to be censured of\u2019\u00a7. \nRegarding the connection of the Palladis Tamia with the \u2018Wit\u2019s Series\u2019, see Poli- \nteuphuia 1598. \nOf this book eleven other copies more or less complete and two fragments can be \ntraced, viz. British Museum (Grenville; Old Royal), Bodleian (Pearson-Malone), \nHuntington (Park-Collier-Locker-Church; Chew), Trinity College Cambridge (Capell), \nFolger (Mostyn; Halliwell; Warwick, a fragment), Charles W.Clark (original vellum), \nand Rosenbach (White, and two other imperfect copies which together make two \nentirely complete copies and a fragment). \n\n$OF this list, fol.268, all but four are known to have been in print at that time and since we have not suc- \nceeded in identifying the titles which are given for these four books they may also have been printed. \nSince Gargantua is also included in the list of books in Captain Coxe\u2019s library (Laneham Letter [1575] \nq.v.) this mention may not refer to either the Prophecie or the History entered in the Stationers\u2019 Register \nin 1592 and 1594 respectively (Arber II.607, 667). \n\nS.T.C, 17834.

However, it is possible that \nthe sole reason for altering the title was that, shortly after the New Year 1609, Eld \neither sold the remainder copies to, or made a publishing contract with Rocket, and \nthat the notes concerning the Black Friars performance and the author\u2019s initials were \nadded when for commercial reasons it was considered necessary to substitute a title \nhaving Rocket\u2019s name in the imprint. \nNine other copies of this issue can be traced, viz. the British Museum (Garrick), \nDyce, Bodleian, Ashley (Hibbert-Sotheby\u2019s 1902), Huntington (Huth; Wright-Kemble- \nDevonshire), Harvard (Locker-White), Wrenn (Hodgson\u2019s, December 1910, resold 26 \nApril 1911), and the Farmer-Chalmers-Holgate-Britwell-T.J.Snyder copy sold Sothe- \nby\u2019s 10 December 1934, Lot 106. \n\nS.T.C. 17896a.

The second issue, though from another setting \nreads, almost literally for the first eighteen lines, i.e. through the author\u2019s name, as in \nthe first issue. Thereafter it has the seven-line notice of the addition inserted which \nmade it necessary to cut the imprint as above. In the first issue it read: \u2018LONDON, | \nPrinted by Nicholas Okes, dwelling at the figne of the | Hand, neere Holbourne-Bridge, \n1613. |\u2019. It was, apparently, decided to append the description of the Islington enter- \ntainment, an earlier ceremony, before all copies of the first sheet were printed for the \namended title is not a cancel. \nThis Triumph is the first of Middleton\u2019s numerous essays of this nature, and is \nchiefly remarkable for that fact and also because it contains what appears to be an \nattack upon Anthony Munday who, except for the year immediately preceding, had \nbeen for some time the professional writer and producer of the London pageants. It \nis not possible to determine how Middleton obtained his commission to arrange this \npageant for he makes no claim of kinship either to the Lord Mayor or to Sir Hugh. \nCopies of either issue of this tract are very rare, the British Museum has copies of \nboth (Old Royal Library; Bright), the Bodleian has a copy of the first issue, as well \nas a copy of the sheet containing the New River Head entertainment. A copy of the \nsecond issue is in the Guild Hall Library and another (possibly the same) was sold at \nSotheby\u2019s in 1897. The Daniel-George Smith copy has not been traced. \n\nS.T.C. 17904.

The \nBridgewater\u2014 Huntington (VII, 1918, Lot 595) \u2014Jones (1919, Lot 1167) copy with bookplates. \n\nIn this copy there are nine manuscript corrections in the text which appear to be in \nMilton\u2019s hand, e.g. see Plate No.XXXI, last page. They are so limited that it is impos- \nsible to be dogmatic, however, the two times that the letter \u2018e\u2019 is used it is given in the \nepsilon form which is characteristic of Milton\u2019s own hand. And even though the letters \nare separated, to imitate print, the little that is here for comparison shows many \nsimilarities to Milton\u2019s hand in the Trinity College Cambridge manuscript. It has \nrecently been observed that in the collected edition of 1645, Comus was printed from \na corrected copy of the present edition (cf. P.M.L.A. LII, p.723). That corrected copy \nno doubt contained numerous corrections, mainly in spelling and punctuation, besides \nthose which occur in the present, see Addenda. \n\u2018That this Bridgewater copy was the one used by the printer of the 1645 edition is \nunlikely, but from the evidence of the manuscript corrections it seems entirely probable \nthat this copy was corrected by Milton himself and presented by him to the Earl of \nBridgewater or to his son, Lord Brackly. It is possible that a presentation inscription \nwas destroyed by the binder who rebound this book early in the nineteenth century \u2014it \nwas he who trimmed off the last four letters of the correction \u2018contemptuous\u2019 on p.21. \nIt is more probable, however that this book was presented without an inscription, for \ntwo copies of the first edition of Lycidas, which may be presumed to be presentation \ncopies and which have similar manuscript corrections, are both without inscription, \n\nviz. the University Library Cambridge and the Old Royal Library copy in the British \nMuseum. \n\n[ 724 ]\n\n",

From the \nbinding this may be the Edwin Henry Lawrence copy, sold Sotheby\u2019s 9 May 1892, Lot 426. \n\nA peep of agreement for the sale of the copyright in this poem was executed by Milton \nand Samuel Simmons 27th April 1667 (Milton\u2019s copy of this agreement, according to \nwhich 1300 copies were prepared, is in the British Museum). Simmons registered for \nhis copy 20th August 1667, and very likely on or about that date issued the book for \nsale. Examination of the text shows that numerous typographical alterations and \ncorrectionst were made while the sheets were going through the press. As was the \ncustom, and for that matter still is, the corrected and uncorrected sheets were gathered \nindiscriminately and so the particular combination of corrected or uncorrected sheets \nin a given copy has no bearing upon the priority, from the bibliographer\u2019s viewpoint, \nor the desirability, from the collector\u2019s. \nThe distinguishing feature of copies of this edition is the state of the title-page. There \nare six states which can be tracedg. Since the text of the poem begins on the first leaf \nof sheet A, the title, as is not uncommon in books of this period, is bibliographically \ndistinct. In the copies of the so-called \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 states in this collection, the \ntitle is the second leaf of a half-sheet the first of which is blank. Since both are dated \n1667 and, except for the sixth line which contains Milton\u2019s name, are from the same \nsetting of type, and since from their imposition there can be no evidence of cancellation, \n\nFor list of many of these alterations see Church Catalogue. Doubtless the projected Columbia University \nedition will ist others. \ntAnother title was exhibited by G.H.Norcross to the Mass. Hist. Soc., 8th April 1909. That title reads as \ndoes a normal sixth title but is dated 1667. An examination of the facsimile printed in the Proceedings \n\nof the Society, however, shows that that title is a type-facsimile based upon a sixth title but set-up in \nCaslon type. \n\n[ 726 ]\n\nthere seems to be no reason why either one should be entitled to priority. However, it \nwould seem more probable that the so-called \u2018second\u2019 state having that line in smaller \ntype was the first for, with the exception of the third state, all the later forms of the \ntitle have the author's name in the larger type and even in the third state which has \nonly his initials the type used is the larger size. Nevertheless, in order to avoid con- \nfusion the order given by Lowndes (Bohn edition, 186s) has been retained in the pres- \nent description with allowance for the omission of the fifth and sixth variants recorded \nby him which have never been found. \nThe third and fourth states are dated 1668. In the third state the author's initials \nonly are given (a variant is noted, Grolier Club W-P II, 191). The fourth has the full \nname restored and a changed imprint, Simmons\u2019s name appearing for the first time and \nwith Samuel Thompson and Henry Mortlack, in place of Parker, as agents. \n\u2018The fifth (q.v.] and sixth states (Lowndes\u2019s seventh and eighth) are both dated 1669. \nIn the fifth state the word \u2018Angel\u2019 in the imprint is in roman whereas in the sixth it is \nin italic. As in the first and second, the evidence for the order of these two states is very \nmeager for since they are not printed from the same setting of type, the variations, \nsuch as they are, may be used to support either thesis. So much for the titles. \nTo add to the complication, the preliminary matter, which from the statement of \nThe Printer to the Reader was not \u2018at first intended\u2019, is known in two settings, with or \nwithout the printer's note, see next number. The problems which thus arise cannot be \nsettled until all available copies of the six states of the title have been examined and \nthe combinations of titles and preliminaries tabulated (proper allowance being made \nfor possible \u2018manufacturing\u2019). It should be observed, however, that copies of all six \nstates of the title are known with either one or both settings of the preliminaries. For \nexample the copy of the second title in this collection which is in original sheep and in \nphysical appearance above suspicion has the setting without the printer's note, while \nthe copy of the same title in the Morgan Library, in a Harleian binding and also \nunimpeachable, has the other setting, note in five-line variant (see next number). But \nas the title in the second state is not an integral part of sheet A, see above, insertion \nis a possibility, indeed, almost a certainty. \nThough we have examined several copies of all the states of the title the only defi- \nnite evidence which we have found regarding the relationship of the states of the title \nto the settings of the preliminaries occurs in the Grolier Club (Fearing) copy of the \nfourth title in which that title is conjugate with Sig [A4] of the setting of the pre- \nliminaries which has The Printer to the Reader note (five-line variant). Similarly, the \nsixth titles in the Lefferts-Hagen and Gott-British Museum copies are conjugate with \nSig [Aq] of the setting without the printer's noteft. The fifth title has the preliminaries \nas in the fourth, see that number. \nAt least two other copies of this first title are known in original sheep, the Cromwell \n\ntfFrom purely internal evidence, the antipodal order might be deduced for the setting without the note \nhas at etvon in the next to the last Ine of the errata which does not occur in the setting with the note and \nmight, except for the evidence above, be regarded as \u2018corrected\u2019 instend of \u2018corrupted\u2019, \n\nVOL.I [77]\n\nand the Lamport-Britwell-Ralph Isham-Terry copies. The British Museum has a com. \nplete set of all the known variant titles. \n\nBaxrer Bibliographer VI (1903) 73-90. Grower CLun W-P II, 187 (tp. facs.).

On the flyleaf is a long note \u2018by Mr. [Samuel] Palmer\u2019, but not in his \nhand, declaring this to be the first book printed by Caxton. \n\nIv 1483, Caxton printed another version of this \u2018preacher's assistant\u2019, as Duff described \nthis work. He did not reprint that text in the present but instead followed the superior \nversion printed at Oxford by Rood and Hunte in 1486. \nCopies of both Caxton\u2019s versions usually have appended copies of the Quattuor \nSermones which supplement the Festial, though the two Caxton editions of the 9.8. \nare bibliographically distinct. However, there can be little doubt but that most, if not \nall, copies of Caxton\u2019s editions of the Festial were originally issued with them appended. \nThere is but one fifteenth century edition, the Rood and Hunte, which does not have a \ncompanion edition of the 2.8., while two editions, the Hopyl, 149, and the Morin, \n1499, have them linked by common signature sequence. \nOnly five other copies of this edition can be traced, all imperfect, viz. the British \nMuseum (James), University Library Cambridge (Potter), Bodleian (Crynes), Rylands \n(Roxburghe-Spencer), and Huntington (Devonshire). Of these only the Bodleian copy \nis without the coeval 9.8. \n\n{Itis, in fact, a collection of sermons drawn from the Legenda Aurea and intended for Sundays and holydays, \nhence called *Festial\u2019. \n\nS.T.C. 17959.

As was pointed out (Trans. \nII], 1923, 177-193) the authorities, even in Elizabeth\u2019s reign, did not cease hindering \nthe publication of this work for, although it was \u2018licensed and perused\u2019 at the urgency \nof the Lord Stafford, three poems which were to have been included had to be omitted. \n\u2018Those poems, all written by George Ferrers, were \u2018Good duke Humfrey murdered, and \nElianor Cobham his wife banifhed\u2019 (two individual poems but thus united in the \nTable which lists them as beginning at fol.40), and the tragedy of the Duke of Somerset. \nThe latter piece was evidently expected up to the last minute though it is not included \nin the Table, presumably an accident, for the prose passage at the end of Jack Cade \nrefers to it; and there is a gap of eleven numbers left at that point in the foliation while \nthe signature sequence is broken alsof. \nOf the present edition seven other copies can be traced, viz. the British Museum \n(Grenville; Blandford-Rhodes), Bodleian (Douce; Wood), Huntington (Chew), Lord \nAldenham, and the Bemis (Chalmers-Britwell-Clawson). \n\n  \n\n{The misnumbering of sheet d (fol.71-4) which contains the tragedy of Henry VI appears to be the result \nof division of copy for the type in that sheet differs from that used elsewhere in the volume. \n\nS.T.C. 1247.

The major alteration consists in the addition \n(recto A2) of references to William Rufus, Robert Duke of Normandy, and the children \nof King Henry, but the phrasing is in several places improved. This edition} contains \nin the first part a paginary (except for minor alterations in the prose introductions) \nreprint of the first edition (q.v.] and in the second part eight new tragedies besides \nSackville\u2019s Induction. From the editor\u2019s note (beginning verso P) it appears that the \n\u2018tragedy\u2019 concerning the two princes murdered in the Tower which the Lord Vaux had \nundertaken to write was not ready and that in place was inserted Sackville\u2019s \u2018tragedy\u2019 \nof Buckingham with the Induction preceding itt}. This alteration in plan probably \naccounts for the change at that point from double to single sheet gatherings. \nThe inclusion here of the tragedy of Somerset which was omitted at the last moment \nfrom the first edition has been explained by Miss Feasey (Trans. LIL, 1923, 187-8). That \npoem, however, does not from a literary viewpoint make this edition so notable as does \nthe appearance for the first time of Sackville\u2019s Induction\u00a7 and Churchyard\u2019s Shore's \nWife. \n\n{The copy was evidently divided between two compositors; one set up sheets B-K, and the other the re- \nmainder. \n\nHin this edition the tragedies of Humphrey and Eleanor are omitted not only from the text but also from \nthe Tabl . \nThe division into two parts of Sackville\u2019s contribution was not apparently intended by the author, see note \nfon the MS, discovered at St, John\u2019s College Cambridge by Miss Margaret Hearsey, R.E.S. VIII (1932) \n232. \n\u00a7The last line of the frst stanza, recto P3, reads in the present: \nblowen.\u2019 while in other copies, e.g, the Church- \ntree downe blowen.\u201d \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n\u201cThe tapets torne, and euery blome downe \nHuntington, itis corrected to: \u2018The tapets torne, and euery \n\n[740 ]\n\nThis edition is much more common than the first for twelve copies can be located \nwhile some half-dozen more are recorded as having passed through the auction rooms \nin the last fifty years. \n\nS.T.C. 1248.

At one time this was bound with early editions of \nthe other parts and contained notes in Haslewood\u2019s hand. Whether it ever belonged to him or \nwas borrowed by him from Heber cannot be determined. \n\nI the second issue, Sig [Fs] is cancelled and replaced by a double sheet signed \u2018F@\u2019 of \nwhich the first leaf contains a reprint of the end of Yames the First on the recto and a \nprose connecting passage on the verso, while the second through the seventh contain \n\n{The date in this copy appears to have been originally 1576 but is here altered in ink to 1578. \n\nVOL.IT [743 ]\n\nthe tragedy of Eleanor Cobham which is thus included for the first time. The last leaf \nof that quire contains a prose link to the tragedy of Duke Humphrey. \nThe occasion of this confusion may have been vacillation upon the part of George \nFerrers who, it is generally believed, had a chief part in the editing of this edition but \nis more likely to have been due to interference by the authorities. Ferrers was the \nauthor of the legends of Eleanor and Humphrey and probably caused their omission \nin the earlier editions. When listed in the contents of the editions of 1559 [q.v.] and \n1571 [q.v.] (these tales did not appear in the text) Humphrey is placed before Eleanor. \nFrom such evidence as can be derived from an examination of the present copy it \nappears that originally it was intended to include both of these legends in this editiont \nand that they were to be printed in that order. For some reason however they were \nheld up, perhaps by the licensers, and so space was left for them and the printer pro- \nceeded with the rest of the book. Before it was completed, however, the embargo against \nthe Humphrey was lifted and it was set-up as in the present{t (Sig [Fs]-[G & H6]). The \npreliminary leaves were then set-up, Humphrey being included in the table, and the \nbook was issued in that form. Later either Ferrers or the licenser changed his mind and \nit was determined that the legend of Eleanor should be included. However, instead of \nsimply inserting it after that of Humphrey, as up to that time it had apparently been \nintended, Ferrers decided\u00a7 that the tragedy of Eleanor logically belonged before that \nof the Duke and that if it was to be included at all it must be in that order. This decision \naccounts for the cancellation and substitution noted above. \nThe Lord Tweedmouth copy in the Huntington Library is apparently the only other \ncopy of the first issue known. \nOf the second issue some half-dozen copies can be located, viz. the British Museum \n(Heber-Cole-Britwell), Bodleian (Douce), Huntington (Chew), Folger, Captain Jag- \ngard, and the Woolaton Hall copy now in the possession of Myers of Bond Street. \n\nHin the first place they are mentioned as \u2018ioyned together\u2019 in the introductory prose passage of the present \nwhich is verbatim from the 1559 edition to that point. In the second place, a gap of two quires (but only \n14 numbers in the foliation) was left in the signature sequence. This is approximately the space which \nboth of these legends would fil. \nH This appears to be substantiated by the fact that though from the watermarks quire F appears to be a \nnormal gathering the last three leaves have the appearance of having been set up at a different time from \nthe rest of the quire. \n\u00a7The reasons for this decision are given in the prose passage found on verso of cancellans Sig F@{x (repeated \nalmost verbatim on fol.140 of the 1587 edition): \u2018. . . But whether of th\u00e9 is fyrst to be placed in the \norder of our boke, I somewhat stande in doute. For albeit the sayde Dukes death happened before the \ndeceasse of the Duches, yet was her fall first, which fynally was cause of ouerthrow to both. Why shoulde \nyou doubte then (quod the rest of \u00a7 company) for seying \u00a7 cause doth alwaies go before theffect and \nsequel of any thing: it is good reason you should begin w her first . . . \u2019. \n\n  \n\nS.T.C, 1252.

Nine of these are in this \ncollection, se Plate No. XXXII. Only one copy of one of the wo editions lackingis known \nin private handst. Complete collections are in the British Museum and the Huntington; \nthe Bodleian lacks one. \nRichard Niccols, the editor of this edition adopted the plan suggested by Sackville of \nomitting the prose links between the legends, and inserting in their place verse \u2018Induc- \ntions\u2019 for each of the four parts into which he divided the book. Generally speaking, \nthis edition is reprinted from that of 1587, to which is added Blenerhasset\u2019s text of 1578, \nten new tragedies by Niccols called \u2018A Winter Nights Vision\u2019, as well as one by Dray- \nton, and a long section also by Niccols, entitled \u2018\u201cEngland\u2019s Eliza\u2019, describing the reign \nof queen Elizabeth. Six of the tragedies formerly in the separate editions are omitted, \nthree because they were otherwise supplied and the rest apparently because they were \nScottish and might be offensive to the new sovereign. \nFor some reason, probably simply because the taste for moralized verse chronicles \nhad passed, the school of Du Bartas being then at its height, this edition did not sell \nand the unsold sheets were reissued with new titles in 1619 (twice), and 1620ff. \nThe general-title in all copies examined is a cancel, for what reason cannot even be \nconjectured. Originally 4 Winter Nights Vision had a dedication to Prince Henry, \nSig [Oo4], but upon the death of that youthful patron of the arts that leaf was can- \ncelled\u00a7 and a new one containing a dedication to the Earl of Nottingham inserted in \nits place. Evidently the substitution was delayed for most copies occur without any \ndedication. \nThe copyright to the older portions of this book descended to Kingston through his \nmother, Joan Orwin, from Thomas Marshe. S.T.C. 18526, an octavo edition of Niccol\u2019s \nWinter Nights Vision, is apparently a ghost for the Bodleian copy is but a fragment of \nthe present. \n\n{The Baldwin, 1575, of which the Huth-Chew is in the Bemis collection which altogether has eight editions. \nHLowndes cites an issue dated 1621, while according to Hazlit (ntiguary XX, 263) there is another dated \n1623, and if the records of the Sewall sale in 1896 are correct, there is also one dated 1653.

Succeeding editors admit his claims to be just and this edition the most \ncorrect of all the early editions and his text, likewise, worthy of the tradition of the \nTudor translators and not easily to be superseded by modern scholarship. It is this \nedition which was reprinted by Morris at the Kelmscott Press. \nThe reason this book was not translated and published before 1551 was perhaps the \nhope expressed by More in his Dialogue against Tyndale (Workes 1557, p-422) that \n\nneither Erasmus\u2019s Moriae nor the present should be translated or published in English. \n\n   \n\nCol.

Sheet bb2-7 is in duplicate. \n\n\u2018Tue printing of this book which Sinker, alone, attributed to Tottell has otherwise been \nassigned to Cawood, probably because of the presence of the title-compartment and \nthe so-called \u2018Anton Sylvius\u2019 initial in the first quire. However, with the exception of \nthat quire, the initials and types used throughout belonged to Tottell before and \nafter the date of publication and therefore, since at that time Tottell had already \nprinted several books furnished him by the editor of the present, it seems reasonable to \nassume that he was the printer. One might even be tempted to say that he printed the \nfirst quire also, borrowing the blocks from his partner in the venture, Cawood, for the \npaper is the same throughout, but there are two points which make such a view hazard- \nous. In the first place, there is an initial \u201cT\u2019 used in that gathering which, though a good \nproportion of Tottell\u2019s work has been searched, has not been identified as his and yet, \nif it is not his, is too insignificant to have been borrowed. Moreover, Paynell, the com- \npiler of the index which occupies the greater part of that quire, had, for some years \nprevious to the publication of this book, dealt exclusively through Cawood. It may well \nbe, therefore, that the agreement among the partners provided that Cawood should be \nresponsible for the indexing and the printing of the preliminaries. This seems the more \nprobable in that the imprint does not mention that it was printed \u2018at the sygne of the \nhande and starre\u2019 (Tottell\u2019s address) while the colophon does. \nThe work of gathering, arranging in chronological order, and of adding the valuable \nmarginal notes was all done by Rastell, More\u2019s nephew, while an exile in Louvain \nduring Edward\u2019s reign. \n\nS.T.C. 18076.

There appears to be no \nother difference and probably copies of both states were published simultaneously by \nCharlewood and White though the latter alone made entry. \nMunday, besides appearing at Campion\u2019s trial as a witness, sought to capitalize his \nconnection with that event by publishing four tracts. The first, 4 driefe discourse of \nthe taking of Campion} was entered 24th July 1581. The second, which appeared after \nCampion\u2019s condemnation, is a very slender piece, An aduertisement and defence for \ntructh against her backbiters, and specially against the whispering fauourers, and colourers \nof Campians 1581. The third is Munday\u2019s semi-official Discouerie of E. Campion and \nhis confederates 1582, which was read at the execution and the credibility of which was \nattacked by 4 true reporte of the death and martyrdome of M. Campion . . . Obserued \nand written by a Catholike preist which was present there at 1582 (S.T.C.4537)+ \nThe present tract Munday wrotett in reply to the strictures of the anonymous priest \nand also in reply to a French tract which appeared in the same year from the press of \nG.Chaudiere, Paris, entitled: Z\u2019 histoire de la mort que le R.P.E. Campion & autres ont \nsouffert en Angleterre (B.M.698.b.39). The autobiographical matter which Munday felt \ncalled upon to include in refutation of the personal attacks made upon him now forms \nthe most valuable portion of the volume here described. \nOnly two other copies having the White imprint are known, the Lambeth and the \nBodleian; while of the Charlewood, there are three copies, viz. the British Museum, \nHuntington (Bridgewater) and the Harmsworth (Heber-Britwell). \n\n{This sheet, from the signatures, appears to be the work of a different compositor. \nThe veracity of Munday\u2019s narrative was questioned by George Ellyot in very true report of the appre- \nhension of Edmond Campion, containing a controulment of a most untrue book set forth by one A.M. \n\nThe entry, 12 March 1582, in the Stationers\u2019 Register was evidently made before the present title was \nselected. \n\nS.T.C, 18262a.

The first two sheets in both are from the same \nsetting except that the formes were evidently removed from the chase and slight \nalterations such as the position of the signatures etc. may be observed. In particular, \nthe verso of [Ag] of the first sheet is respaced. Sheets B-N, however, are entirely reset. \nThat this was not a case of simultaneous printing seems assured by the fact that the \nsecond edition has inserted on verso N2 a passaget which reads in part: \u201cAnd for that \nmany mallicious tongues haue spoken their pleasures of this former part (ie. the pres- \nent for in the preceding sentence Munday announced \u2018The secdd part of the Watch- \nwoord\u2019)\u201d.

This is \nperhaps the earliest of Munday\u2019s antiquarian compilations and includes several inter \nesting anecdotes although, on the whole, it is a rather dry recital of the treasons prac- \ntised from the reign of Richard I to the year 1584. \nCopies of the present edition are in the British Museum (George ITI), Bodleian \n(Tanner; Crynes), and the Huntington.

The fourth edition, 1616, is known by \ntwo imperfect copies, the British Museum (Grenville, second part only) and Harms- \nworth (Britwell, imperfect copy). The present is therefore the earliest edition of which \nthere is a perfect copy.

It has been shown by W.E.Purser, 1907, that it was not \noriginally a Spanish romance, as was for many years supposed, but a Portuguese \nwritten by Moraes. \nA translation of the third part of this work was separately published, 1602; in 1685 \nit appeared with the first two parts}. It was Southey\u2019s opinion that Munday translated \nonly the first part and that others, less qualified, completed it. As it has only recently \nbeen proved that Lazarus Pyott, who completed the translation of Amadis, was not \nMunday\u2019s assumed name but a real person, possibly Southey\u2019s suggestion might be \nworth investigation. \n\n{The Pearson-Steevens-W.H.

VOL. | 1]. . . \"on spine. 634 x 524 inches. \nThe W.E.Burton (1860, Lot 1374) copy, bound for that distinguished comedian and collector, \nwith his name in gilt on spine. \nBound with this collection are Microcosm 1637, and Hannibal and Scipio 1637, which, though \nlikewise bound with the other two known copies, were probably not originally issued with it \nhaving, presumably, been sold out before 1639. Otherwise they would probably have been pur- \nchased from Greene by the publisher of this collection and issued with cancel titles in it. \n\u2018And bound together in a volume uniform with the present are The Bride 1640, and The Unfor- \ntunate Mother 1640. These were published by other booksellers and from their date and condition \nobviously not originally issued with this collection though now also bound with the other known \ncopies. \n\nTue three plays listed above which do belong in this collection were originally printed \nin 1638 for Charles Greene but are here issued together in one volume, with cancel \ntitles and a general-title, all without publisher's name and all dated 1639. \nIt is of interest to note that these four titles are in part from the same setting, as may \nbe seen from imperfections in the type and ornaments, from the rule above the author's \nname to the end of the imprint except in The Spring\u2019s Glory and the general-title which \nhave an \u2018E\u2019 inserted in Nabbes\u2019s name and the printer altered from \u2018R.Oulton\u2019 to \n\u2018I.Dawfon\u2019. The latter was the actual printer of all these titles but Oulton was the \noriginal printer of Covent-Garden and Totenham-Court and his name was therefore \nretained in the imprints. Dawson originally printed The Spring's Glory. \nAlthough Greene was the proprietor of the copyright in these three plays it is proba- \nble, from the evident care taken to delete his name from the cancel titles, that they \nwere issued in this collected form by someone who had bought the remainder stock of \nthese plays from Greene. A clue to the identity of this bookseller is the address \u2018at the \nsigne of the White-Lyon and Ball in Saint PAULS Churchyard.\u2019 Now Fussell, who was \nGreene's agent for The Spring's Glory 1638, used the sign of the White Lion then and \nagain in 1639 when he sold, also for Greene, Austin\u2019s Haec Homo. According to Sayle, \nhe likewise used the sign of the Ball, at least from 1631-5. Consequently, the evidence \npoints to Fussell as the publisher of this collection. \nFor similar enterprises see Chapman's A/ fooles 1605, Marston\u2019s Wonder of Women \n1606, Lee\u2019s Constantine 1684, Otway's Friendship in fashion 1678, and Shadwell\u2019s \nHumorists 1671. \nThe only other copies of this collection which can be tracedf are those in the British \nMuseum and Boston Public (Pearson\u2014Reed\u2014Heber\u2014 Barton) Libraries. They have \nbeen, like the present, \u2018completed\u2019 by later owners. \n\nHohn Parker who was associated with Greene in several enterprises used the latter sign about 16195 his \naddress in 1639 is not known, \n\nThere was a copy in the library of George Daniel. \n\n[ 768 J\n\n_gopencesnencaaagy | \nSP layes, Maskes sEpi- e \n: grams Elegies,and 8 \nax \n\u00a9 Epithalamiums, 2 \n% @ \n& Colle\u00e9ted into one Volumne. $ \n& &) \neo . ieee \np.m Monten 3 \ne ee iaisialil \nNS oe awh eee \n@ LONDO Ny, cn \n\u2018ae byes infor, And are to be fold Gee \n& he oe gman al i Sa Paurs @ \n\nke a \n\n?",

This very finet \ncopy is partly unopened. \n\n\u2018Tus work is written in a vein far removed from the scurrilous badinage usually \nassociated with the productions of Nashe\u2019s pen. This change of heart may, as Dr. \nMcKerrow suggests, have been occasioned by personal misfortunes or loss of health \nbut, in any case, appears to have been sincere even extending to the offer of an apology \nto Gabriel Harvey in the address To the Reader. \nIn this volume Nashe compares the circumstances which brought about the siege \nand destruction of Jerusalem with the life of London at that time and prophecies a \nsimilar fate for London if her course is unchecked. The first part deals with Jerusalem \nand is taken from Joseph Ben Gorion\u2019s History of the latter times of the Jews\u2019 common- \nweal of which numerous editions of Morvyn\u2019s translation were published in the six- \nteenth century; the latter part (fol. 38 to end) deals with London. \nThe sincerity or at least the vigor of Nashe\u2019s \u2018exposure\u2019 of the greed of the mercan- \ntile class and the malfeasance of public officers seems to have brought him into serious \ntrouble with the authorities. Such denunciations were common enough in books of the \nperiod so that \u2018either we must suppose that some recent scandal had given to the \npassage a special point, and even perhaps a personal application or that those in \nauthority had already some ill will against Nashe and were more than usually quick \nto find cause of offence\u2019. \nTherefore, when the unsold sheets were reissued in 1594, it was deemed advisable \nor necessary to cancel Sig X3tt which contained the objectionable passages and to \nsubstitute a leaf in which while much the same accusations were made they are more \nvague and the author disclaims any special knowledge of the offenders\u00a7. At the same \ntime, Nashe availed himself of the opportunity to revoke his proffered apology to \nHarvey and open again the quarrel with him for, it was probably after the publication \n\ntWhen sold in the Heber sale it was in original vellum. A portion of the old wrapper is inserted with W.H. \nMiller's notes. \n\n4 The state of Sig X3 may be recognized by the variant readings given in McKerrow Nashe Il, 158-9. The \n\ncancellans is without foliation or catchword on recto; and the headline is in smaller type than elsewhere \nin the book, \n\n$e is of interest to note that the second edition, 1613, was printed from a copy of the first issue, 1593 and \ntherefore has the original passages of X3 (there Yi). \n\n(7721\n\nof the present issue of this book that Harvey's New Letter [gor] appeared, though \nperhaps without Harvey's knowledge and against his wishes, \u2018The alteration woe \neffected by discarding the first sheet and substituting two new ones (signed + and \nv4; the first leaf of being a blank, the last of, the cancel for X3) containing atte. \npage dated 1594, the same dedication as before, but reset, a new address To the Reader \nwithout the appended errata. These new sheets were probably printed by Richard \nField, at least his device appears on the title and Roberts\u2019s name is omitted from the \nimprint. \nThe British Museum, Bodleian and Huntington Libraries have copies of both issues \nbut no others can be traced. \n\nS.T.C. 18366.

Dr. McKerrow suggests that it may have been revised for a later performance \nbefore Elizabeth but Sir Edmund Chambers disposes of that possibility somewhat con- \nclusively and, further, shows that it may well have been produced by members of \nWhitgift\u2019s household rather than by a professional company. - \nThe \u2018Summers\u2019 of the title is of course Will Sommers, the jester of Henry VIII to \nwhom there are frequent references in English literature for more than a century after \nhis death in 1560. \n\nVOL.I [775]\n\nIt is not possible to explain the cancellation of Sig C3-4, but whatever may have been \nthe cause it was apparently decided upon before sheet D was set-up, for the catchword \n\u2018on verso C2 corresponds with the first line of recto D.

The erroneous ascription of this book to the press \nof John Charlewood and the equally wrong date, 1589, have been based upon Herbert's \nnote on his copy and his entry in Ames. He was apparently mislead by connecting this \ntitle with the Tisdale entry noted above, Charlewood being Tisdale\u2019s successor. The \nprinter, however, was Jugge, and the date, from the state of the blocks used, was \nbefore 1577, and, from the circumstance that the dedicatee did not become Lady \nChenie until 1572, after that event. \nThis morality is a translation of the Tragedia di F.

No. 773\n\n\n\nOr the first edition published under the titlet \u2018Gorboduc\u2019, printed by William Grfith \n1565, only the Bridgewater-Huntington copy is knowng. That edition has been stig, \nmatized as \u2018unauthorized\u2019 by reason of \u2018Day's statement in his address prefixed to de \npresent that it was printed from \u2018a copie therof\u2019 obtained by \u2018W[illiam]. G[riffith].\u2019 \u2018at \nsome yongmans hand that lacked a little money and much discretion\u2019. Despite those \nimplications it is at least doubtful whether the authors of this piece were not party to \nthe 1565 publication. But, whether they were or not, the text then printed, despite the \nassertions of the present title, appears to be more nearly like that which was acted in \n1562, including as it does some eight lines omitted in the present presumably because \nof their dangerous political trend, for the differences between the two texts otherwise \nconsists mainly of verbal alterations made in an effort to polish and improve the metre \nas well as the sense. \nIndeed, there is some reason for thinking that the present edition was published not \nas the \u2018authorized\u2019 text of the earliest English tragedy but as one of a group of political \ntracts printed by Day in 1569 and 1570 and reissued under the general-ttle \u2018All such \ntreatises as haue been lately published by Thomas Norton (1570)\u2019\u00a7 In this connection \nit is significant that the next edition [q.v.] which reverts to the original title, was \nappended to Lydgate\u2019s political tract, The serpent of divisionta. \nProbably because copies of this edition were preserved from destruction by being \nbound in the collection described above, itis not a particularly rare book. Besides the \ncopies in the British Museum (Garrick), Dyce (Ireland-Roxburghe-Blandford-Heber), \nRiblioth\u00e9que National (Bliss), and Bodleian (Malone), there are copies in the Hunting \nton (Edwardes Hoe; Hoe), Folger (Locker-Chew-Huntington-Jones), Chapin (Pearson- \nCharlemont-Huth), and the Harvard Libraries, as well as in the collections of Dr. \nRosenbach (Ireland-Bindley-Jolley-Corset-Crawford-White) and Mr. Frank J. Hogan \n(Sotheby's 1993). The Wright-Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington-Clawson copy is now \nowned by an American collector. \n\n  \n\n  \n\ntin that title, as in the third edition [q.v.], the first three acts are attributed to Norton and the last two to \nSackville, a division now generally accepted. \nff'The Locker so-called \u2018frst edition\u2019, from the collation, is a copy of the 1390 edition [q.v,}. However, \n\u2018Thomas Hearne, the eighteenth century antiquary, had a copy which may stil be extant, see B.Botfeld \nBibliotheca Hearneiana (1848) 38. \n{ln that collection Ferrex and Porrexi listed sixth in the contents, and in four ofthe seven complete copies \nrecorded it is still bound in that order. \njaRegarding the political purpose of this play see N. & \nWatt Bulletin of the Unio. of Wisconsin No.3st (1910); \n\n9, and Series, Vol. 10, 261-3; dissertation by HA. \n\u2018and $.A.Small P.M.L.A.

In 1692, another general-title was printed which substitutes The \nSecond Part of Scapin for Titus and Berenice and adds a ninth play The History and \nFall of Caius Marius.

In English literature it is preceded in that kind only by the attempts \nin Surrey\u2019s translation of the fourth book of the Aeneid [q.v.] and in Tottel\u2019s Miscellany \n(q.v.]. However, shortly thereafter or in the same year, for a comparison of the entries \nin the Stationers\u2019 Register with the date on the title indicates that it may be old style, \nSpenser also tried his hand at unrhymed verse in his contribution to Van der Noot\u2019s \nTheatre 1569 [q.v.]. og \nThe present work, according to the translator\u2019s statement in the dedication, is the \n\u2018first fruites of his travaile\u2019. The answers attributed on the title to Aulus Sabinus, the \n\n[ 789 ] \n\nVOL.\n\nfriend of Ovid, were not written by him but by a poet of the fifteenth century, Ange \nCneo Sabinus (1468-74). \nCopies of all the early editions} of this the first English translation of the Epistolae \nHeroidum are exceedingly rare, so rare in fact that information about them is somewhat \nconfused. The copy here described appears to be the only perfect copy of the first \nedition extant unless the Heber-Britwell-Huntington copy, which to be sure does not \nlack any leaves but is somewhat damaged and repaired, be accounted \u2018perfect\u2019 also. \n\u2018The British Museum (Freeling-Corser), Capell, and White (now at the Rosenbach Co.) \ncopies as well as the two copies which have appeared at Sotheby's in recent years are \nall lacking one or more leaves. \n\nThe second edition, 1569, of which we have traced only five copies, is dated in the Short-Title Catalogue \n\u201c{1569) from the fact that the British Museum copy lacks the title-leaf, Of the third edition only the \nCorser-British Museum and the Chalmers-Britwell-Harmsworth copies can be traced. The fourth edition, \nprinted by Charlewood, appears to be the commonest of all and was probably not printed until after 8th \nJanuary 1584 when Denham yielded the title along with several others for the use of the poor of the \nStationers\u2019 Company (Arber 11.789), an opportunity which Charlewood appears to have taken advantage \nof as few other printers did. \n\n  \n\nS.T.C. 18940.
