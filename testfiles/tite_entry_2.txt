* TIBERIUS C.XI Life of Charlemagne; chronicles; ete. 
Catalogues: 35213, fol. 43 (art. 3 only); 6018, no. 156; 
36789, fol. 79; 36682. 
Previous ownership: (of fols 28-45, art. 3) Emmanuel 
Demetrius (73.1). There is correspondence, beginning in 
1601, to Cotton from Demetrius in Jul. C.III, fols 138-42. 
‘Loans: Francis Tate, 1612-16 (73.1); Patrick Young, ¢.1616 
(49.20, 134.2); ‘Tate, before 1617 (111.6); Richard 
Montague, 1621 (2.95, 4.40). The wording of the loan 
at 111.6 suggests that the borrowing there was a con- 
‘inuation of that at 73.1, in which case the loan to Young, 
is likely to have preceded that to Tate. 
Fols 28-45, art. 3, used by John Selden and listed 
(‘Chartular{y] . . of the Church of Utrecht’) as a Cotton 
manuscript in his Historie of Tithes, 1618. His extract 
‘on p. 73 is from fol. 32v of the manuscript (the under- 
lining here and elsewhere presumably being done by or 
for Selden). See also his p. 50.
